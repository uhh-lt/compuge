"FAT32 [SEP] NTFS [SEP] You need to make sure that any device that will access the hard drive can read the NTFS file system.  With Windows it's not an issue as all versions from XP onwards can.  The question then becomes can the PS3 access a NTFS drive? Judging from the first link (admittedly from 2007) that turned up from a search for ""PS3 NTFS"" I would say not.  ",0,0
pay now [SEP] pay later [SEP] I'm not going to try and answer this any better then FoxNews Article did.  The gist of the story is basically that car rental companies are getting at least some money from their fleet even if you cancel or don't show up.  From what I just gathered on Avis the cancellation fees are $25.00 if you do it more then 6 hours before or $100 if you are a No Show or doing it less then 6 hours before the pick-up time.  The article also mentions that there are potential discounts that you could be missing out on once you prepay.  ,0,0

"Hongqiao [SEP] Pudong [SEP] With the help of Google maps, using the public transport option, it seems that Hongqiao aiport is closer and needs less time and less subway stops (cheaper?).  Using subway, Hongqiao Airport to People's Square is 51 minutes away with 11 stops while from Pudong Airport you will need 1h25m with 17 stops.  ",0,0
vinaigrette [SEP] pouring oil and vinegar separately on salad [SEP] A vinaigrette is not a stable emulsion so it will eventually separate- however it will stay together long enough for the salad to be immediately served and eaten.  I find that pouring the oil and acid separately creates a salad with a mouthful of olive oil coating the leaves and pool of vinegar at the bottom of the plate.  It's true that the oil in a vinaigrette will eventually wilt the salad but that is why it should be added at the last minute or even after the salads have been portioned.  ,0,0
"Diet Coke [SEP] regular Coca-Cola and other soft drinks [SEP] Two possibilities spring to mind.  Coca Cola is produced by local partners,   [REF]   it is possible that the local partner in Indonesia does not have the space on its production line to make diet coke, which means that it would have to be imported, hence the higher price.  The second thought that I had was to do with size. The screen shot you attached does not show the portion size, if diet coke is only available for example in 500ml, but the others are served as 330ml then that might explain the price difference.  Hope this helps  ",0,0
"scales [SEP] chords [SEP] To the extent that these subtopics are very interrelated, it doesn't really matter which one you start with. Whichever appeals to you is probably the best, all else being equal. Chords are of course built out of scales, so you could learn some chords first, then something about scales, then analyze the scales that are used to build those basic chords. At some point, if you're doing it right, they pretty much cease to be separate areas, and just become part of your harmonic analysis arsenal. Any scale can be harmonized into a spectrum of chords.

"Windows XP (x64) [SEP] Windows Server 2008 (x64) [SEP] Windows Server 2008 have same base as Vista.  But if you have only this options, I recommend Server 2008.  Because XP (x64) is very old and MS support has expired and haven't new updates.  UPDATE: You mentioned ""web development"" and for this is good Server, because have hyper-v for virtualization.

"1-year professional masters at excellent school [SEP] 2-year research-oriented masters at great school [SEP] One year course based MS degree programs are typically ""terminal degrees"" designed for students who want to work in industry and not pursue a PhD and an academic career.  If you want to work in industry and are prepared to give up on any hope of an academic career, then you should seriously consider the one year MS program.  If you want to keep open the possibility of doing a PhD later, you should go for the 2 year MS program with thesis.  ",1,0
Windows 7 RC [SEP] the RTM [SEP] Paul Thurrott has a full breakdown of the features included in Windows 7 RTM.  I know that the Guest Mode feature has been removed from Windows 7.  ,1,0
"Pie [SEP] Tart [SEP] Generally speaking, a pie refers to a pastry covered with a lid, like a typical apple pie. A tart is open topped, like a quiche, or a French tartes aux pommes.  However, there are exceptions to this: many pies will be open topped too. Usually this is a matter of depth: the deeper it is, the more likely it is to be called a pie rather than a tart.  Regional variations also apply.  ",2,0
"Cd Burning Software [SEP] built in Windows CD Burner [SEP] There are more features then just simple file cd burning.     You can burn a variety of disk images (ISO, etc.)    Video cd's (VCD's)     You have much more control over burn speeds and drive progress monitoring.    Some software has cd label features (lightscribe, sticker labels)   Ability to save file lists and cd layouts.  Visual GUI elements to remind you of disk space available.  Much better CD-RW support  Better Audio CD support (tags, cd-text, mp3 cd's, etc.)    This all depends on which software package you choose, but those are some of the common enhancements over windows basic file burn.

"MS One Care [SEP] Spyware Doctor [SEP] Windows live one care is EOL, Microsoft Security Essentials is the new product and I personally love it.  I think it is a very good anti virus solution that will serve you well.  Never heard of Spyware Doctor, and just because Microsoft may be a ""jack-of-all-trades"" doesn't mean they can't release good products.  Link to Microsoft Security Essentials  ",2,0
"write ""we"" [SEP] ""I"" [SEP] A research statement is a mix of past and future.    When you are talking about the past, you should be honest about the fact that you are not working in isolation---in fact, that is a good thing.  Use ""we"" or ""my collaborators and I"" or whatever most accurately describes what actually happened.  The other key part of a research statement, however, is your views about the future: what you think is important, what your ambitions are for the future, etc.  Those are unambiguously your own opinions, and should be ""I"" statements.

"using books [SEP] jumping straight into a project [SEP] False dichotomy; I routinely work on a project while reading a book.  I will say this: if you just read a book without actually programming anything then you are not gonna learn the language. Now whether you're reading from a book or from the web while working on your project matters little; obviously you want a good resource and not a crappy one, but there are both good and bad learning resources in both book form and on the web.

"silken tofu [SEP] regular tofu [SEP] Yes, silken tofu is undrained tofu. In Japan it is often eaten raw, in dishes like miso soup or even simply dipped in soy sauce. However, you can certainly cook it as well - it is especially useful as an egg substitute in vegan cookery (any number of recipes online).   Firm tofu is probably better for frying with as it holds its shape. If you have the time, patience and equipment (some form of weight and some muslin) you could press silken tofu to make firm, but firm is just as readily available.  ",1,0
"32 [SEP] 64 Bit OS [SEP]   Is there any problems with having 8 GB ram in a 32 bit Windows Vista? As i understand it, i would simply only be able to utiluse ~3,2 GB of them. The rest would just be unsused. Is this correct?    Yes, the extra memory will be physically present, but not usable by a 32-bit OS. It will not cause problems.  ",0,0
"tomatoes, then juice [SEP] tomatoes & juice [SEP] It doesn't look like it'd make much difference to that recipe. The juice goes in right after the tomatoes, so it's not like they cook on their own significantly. The one thing you get out of adding the tomatoes first is a way to get them spread evenly around the pan without having to stir, so they're mostly on top of the onions and get gentler heat at first. But you'll be stirring soon anyway, so just dumping it all in wouldn't make much difference at all.  ",0,0
"Ph.D. adviser [SEP] Ph.D. advisor [SEP] According to the New Oxford American Dictionary (that I have by default on my Mac :)):     The spellings adviser and advisor are both correct. Adviser is more common, but advisor is also widely used, especially in North America. Adviser may be seen as less formal, while advisor often suggests an official position.    Since it's an official position, I'd rather go for Ph.D. advisor  ",0,0
"to use preprocessor directive [SEP] if(constant) statement [SEP] I think there is one advantage of using a #define that you didn't mention, and that is the fact that you can set the value on the command line (thus, set it from your one-step build script).   Other than that, it is generally better to avoid macros. They don't respect any scoping and that can cause problems. Only very dumb compilers can't optimize a condition based on a compile-time constant. I don't know if that is a concern for your product (for example it might be important to keep the code small on embedded platforms).  ",0,0
"to using a griddle [SEP] a cast-iron skillet [SEP] Yes, you don't have the edge of a pan in the way when going to flip things, but it also means that you don't have a mass of metal there to add as a heat sink, which can help dramatically when pre-heating your pans, as they'll be evenly heated across their bottom more quickly (at least, compared to something of the same material, such as a cast iron skillet)  More importantly, in my opinion, is that without the sides, you don't hold in moist air, so when cooking things like hash browns, you can get a better crust on 'em without steaming them.

"Dell's XPS [SEP] Studio XPS laptops [SEP] There is one post at MWolk -- Difference between Dell XPS and Dell Studio.  Compares Dell XPS 1530 and Studio 15 to highlight differences.  Summary from there.    Studio is newer design, XPS is older best-selling model  XPS has a nVidia 8600 GT while Studio has Intel’s graphics card X3100  There are slightly different HDD options      This may be dated comparison.  I'd suggest you invite quotes from Dell directly.  That's always more helpful.  ",1,0
"Agile [SEP] XP [SEP] You are confusing the issue. Being agile means that you are following a bunch of values and practices from the agile manifesto. Thats it.   XP and Scrum are development processes that follows those values. Both are ""just as agile"". The big difference between Scrum and XP is that Scrum does not contain practices specifically for programming, whereas XP has lots of them (TDD, continuous integration, pair programming).   ",2,0
"Windows 7 [SEP] XP [SEP] Windows 7 is pretty snappy. There are still a few aspects that slow it down in the every day use but compared to Windows XP & Vista, it does pretty well.  ",0,0
"ASP.Net [SEP] WPF(C#) [SEP] It certainly sounds to me like a WPF app, with lot's of user interaction and potentially interacting with hardware.  You can deliver the app via Click-Once so deployment is mostly a non-issue.  Your WPF app can access a WCF service and deliver the data as binary so the performace will be excellent.  I would start reading up on WPF and getting familiar with it as soon as possible.  ",0,0
"a skilled team [SEP] good process practice [SEP] If your team isn't skilled (as in your definition), you will get nothing done at all. In this case the process doesn't matter.  Not skilled in the sense of not much experience would be another matter. If your people are talented, but have not much experience with projects, then a good process may help avoid problems. Testing and early response from customers as Agile provides would most likely avoid many problems in such a situation.  ",1,0
stainless steel [SEP] Teflon [SEP] The advantage of using stainless steel is the fond (tasty brown bits) that form in the pan.  It both flavors whatever you are sauteing and is often used as the base for a pan sauce.  ,0,0
"the exceptional programmers [SEP] the really good ones [SEP]   Humble: An exceptional programmer will never claim their code is the best, in fact they will always be looking for a better way (Every chance they get.).  Patient: An exceptional programmer will have boundless patience (This does not mean they will waste days on a problem. See: Troubleshooter).  Troubleshooter: An exceptional programmer will be able to solve a problem in minutes that may take days for your average programmer.  Curious: An exceptional programmer will be unable to resist trying to figure out why something occurs.  Engineer: An exceptional programmer will engineer systems rather than hobble together a mishmash of frameworks (This does not mean they won't use frameworks.).    ",0,0
"in US dollars [SEP] the local currency [SEP] If you pay by Dollar (or home currency) The hotel will add a charge for this, hence you will be paying more.  If you pay by local currency the exchange rate will be decided by the credit card company or bank. These exchange rates are much better than the hotel rates.  Check this Visa page for more information regarding this service for Visa holders. AFAIK, Other companies have similar services so this applies to all other credit cards.  ",0,0
