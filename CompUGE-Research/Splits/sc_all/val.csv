"IntelliJ [SEP] Eclipse [SEP] I work with Intellij (9.0.4 Ultimate) and Eclipse (Helios) every day and Intellij beats Eclipse every time.   How? Because Intellij indexes the world and everything just works intuitively. I can navigate around my code base much, much faster in Intellij. F3 (type definition) works on everything - Java, JavaScript, XML, XSD, Android, Spring contexts. Refactoring works everywhere and is totally reliable (I've had issues with Eclipse messing up my source in strange ways). CTRL+G (where used) works everywhere. CTRL+T (implementations) keeps track of the most common instances that I use and shows them first.   Code completion and renaming suggestions are so clever that it's only when you go back to Eclipse that you realise how much it was doing for you. For example, consider reading a resource from the classpath by typing getResourceAsStream(""/ at this point Intellij will be showing you a list of possible files that are currently available on the classpath and you can quickly drill down to the one you want. Eclipse - nope.  The (out of the box) Spring plugin for Intellij is vastly superior to SpringIDE mainly due to their code inspections. If I've missed out classes or spelled something wrong then I'm getting a red block in the corner and red ink just where the problem lies. Eclipse - a bit, sort of.  Overall, Intellij builds up a lot of knowledge about your application and then uses that knowledge to help you write better code, faster.  Don't get me wrong, I love Eclipse to bits. For the price, there is no substitute and I recommend it to my clients in the absence of Intellij. But once I'd trialled Intellij, it paid for itself within a week so I bought it, and each of the major upgrades since. I've never looked back.  ",0

"to travel by train [SEP] plane [SEP] Here's my take, which isn't actually based on anything empirical as much as about a decade living on the East Coast:  If you're along the Acela corridor, served by the Acela Express and the Northeast Regional lines, your best bet is probably the train. This is rooted by two experiences:    Boston Logan is built out in what is essentially the Atlantic Ocean. It also has delays and closures at the drop of a hat. I hated flying out of Logan in the winter.  During the massive snow emergency last year (Winter 2010) in the Eastern U.S., the trains kept running long after the airports shut down. One train I was on was indeed crowded with people from canceled airline flights trying to make it to their destinations, and it was so apparent that Amtrak actually ran a print ad campaign in some East Coast cities about it.

"wooden woodwinds [SEP] plastic [SEP] The basic answer (which applies to carbon fiber stringed instruments too) is that our current understanding of materials science is insufficient to produce a material which exhibits as ""flat"", i.e. uniform frequency resonance curve as wood.  Keep in mind that it takes a lot of skill to select proper wood -- there's a reason reed instruments are made primarily of grenadilla and not any old tree from your backyard :-) .    Consider, OTOH, the fact that I've never even seen a wood mouthpiece.  There are many different styles and types of rubber/plastic ones, and some clarinetists swear by the crystal models (and saxophonists looking for giant sound use Otto Link metal mouthpieces).  Just pointing out that sometimes there are tradeoffs made in the interest of reliability as well as sound quality.  BTW, I used to play a metal clarinet in marching bands.  It sounded crappy but I suspect a properly designed and built model would sound fine, albeit more saxophonish.    For that matter, solid metal 'brass' instruments tend to sound better than their fiberglass brethren.  It's just a lot less painful to march with a lightweight Sousaphone, and the delta sound quality doesn't matter a whole lot in a football stadium.  ",0
"a dethatching rake [SEP] a regular rake [SEP] Where in California (according to your SE profile) are you?  Am asking, as from my limited research (knowledge) on grass types used in California, I discovered:    Northern California tends to favour cool season lawns.  Southern California tends to favour warm season lawns.    If you do have a warm season lawn (grass type), for the overall health of your lawn you should only dethatch in Spring, once the grass has woken from dormancy & is actively growing.  Dethatching at any other time of year greatly increases the chance of causing real damage to a warm season lawn.  On the other hand, if you have a cool season lawn (grass type), without a shadow of a doubt the best time of year to treat, perform maintenance, on your lawn is late Summer, early Autumn (Fall). Around ""Labor Day"" in the USA is generally considered about ideal.  Now adding onto ""Mancuniensis"" answer, I recommend paying a visit to your local tool hire shop (store) and rent yourself a mechanically powered Dethatcher (a machine you walk behind, just like a lawnmower) for a ½ or full day.  Additionally, as you paint a picture of a bad thatch problem, I would also be very tempted to get hold of a mechanically powered Aerator and aerate your lawn after dethatching. Doing so will open up the soil, get some much needed air in there.  Then after doing that, I would give your lawn a ""natural"" feed with a allover covering of ½ to 1inch (12.5 to 25mm) thick layer of screened compost (preferably STA-certified or similar).  ",2
pay now [SEP] pay later [SEP] I'm not going to try and answer this any better then FoxNews Article did.  The gist of the story is basically that car rental companies are getting at least some money from their fleet even if you cancel or don't show up.  From what I just gathered on Avis the cancellation fees are $25.00 if you do it more then 6 hours before or $100 if you are a No Show or doing it less then 6 hours before the pick-up time.

"Apache Solr [SEP] non-Java competition [SEP] Don't know anything about Sphinx, but both Solr and Zend_Search_Lucene are based on Lucene (to be precise, Solr uses Lucene directly and Zend_Search is derived from Lucene).

What is good about Solr is that is packed with a lot of features which save you a lot of time. For instance you can query Solr and have it send response in PHP serialize format, so you can get the results with simple unserialize() instead of parsing. You would have to develop all the bits yourself with Zend_Search.  ",0

"3,5mm input [SEP] a USB audio interface [SEP] From the options you gave I suggest the first one.   To connect to the 3,5mm input is not a good option. There are several disadvantages & problems that might come up, the worst are latency, low sound quality and physical limitations with the 3,5 mm input. Latency means that when you play/record the audio interface might have a delay, late answer, in timing; which can be very annoying and frustrated when you are recording. It will make you play/record worst. The sound quality, sampling rate, conversion from analog to digital are also weak/poor quality and are also a downside that will make you disappointed.  I would go for a USB audio interface and avoid something too cheap. I suggest this product/price range as a starting point.   ",0

"""Wallpaper*"" guidebooks [SEP] others [SEP] Wallpaper travel guides are an offshoot of Wallpaper* Magazine, the self-proclaimed ""world's number one global design destination, championing the best in architecture, interiors, fashion, art and contemporary lifestyle.""  Or, if you haven't drunk enough of the Tyler Brûlé Kool-Aid to suppress your gag reflex when hearing the words ""contemporary lifestyle"", it's a magazine catering squarely to pretentious yuppies who want to read articles and see pretty pictures about obscenely expensive things they're unlikely to ever buy, and invariably glowing reviews of insufferably hip and obscure shops, restaurants and bars they're unlikely to ever visit.  Compile enough of these articles about a single place together and, ta-dah, you've got a Wallpaper travel guide.  So the bulk of the content is, IMHO, ""dumbed-down directories of overpriced shopping and dining for posers""; see the website's travel section for a sampling.  I'm particularly impressed by their list of ""10 travel essentials"", and will definitely take a brass-studded Petit Dejeuner trunk along next time I hitchhike.  But hey, if you just can't make up your mind about which hotel in Paris to blow €695/night on and ""bespoke Lasvit chandeliers made up of 800 individual hand-blown crystal leaves"" happen to be your thing, maybe Wallpaper is what you're looking for.  (And FWIW, I've actually got some respect for Tyler, his current mag Monocle has interesting stuff every now and then.  But he left Wallpaper in 2002 and its current owner, Time-Warner, has been milking the cash cow for every cent they can get ever since.)  ",0

online [SEP] at the airport [SEP] I might contribute some inside knowledge since I am working for a company which contributed the software for a major cheap-flight company.   Generally the prices are determined by offer and the demand BUT there is another major variable (in fact several) in the game for short-booking. Statistics show that most (80%) last-minute bookers are in an important need for the short booking and therefore willing to pay more. So the function which generates the price for short-bookings is not a complete function of offer and demand any more like it was years ago.  If you want to know what's the deal do the following: Go to your online bookers homepage. Search for a flight which is taking off today and try to book that ticket. With this you firstly know how short you can book online and secondly if the prices are acceptable for you.   Your question is also highly location dependant. In the country I live (Switzerland) I get the cheapest flights through a friend who works at the airport and calls me when a certain flight is available. I can only recommend trying both the online and physical approach.  ,1
"Ubuntu [SEP] Mac OS [SEP] It depends on whether or not you'll use the advantages of owning a mac.  Being a Win->Linux->Mac->Linux user, I've established the following:  Buy a mac if:    You have a mac store in your area. Problems that arise can be solved right at the local store, and are covered for free for a year through AppleCare.  Otherwise, its the same as having a support plan from any other big name company.  You will actually get use out of proprietary software (iLife, etc).  I found that the only proprietary app I used was Garage Band, and that was for fun/free time, and there are definitely MUCH better alternatives.  You're OK conforming to forced upon and immutable design decisions. Keep reading 'different style laptop' and 'ui customization' below.    Buy a PC if:    Using Linux, you want to do anything.  As some have mentioned, ""linux is good for computer savvy people/developers.""  This is a misconception, as I have seen both smart and dumb users from age 7 to age 82 using Ubuntu with no trouble.  On the other end, I've seen advanced users with fully custom systems that do everything they want, and usually for no financial cost(time cost though).  You don't NEED apple software.  There are as good or better alternatives to any apple software.  You want more choices.  By buying a PC:  You have many choices for different manufacturers and hardware.  You can spend as much as you want to spend on a laptop, and don't have to pay a proprietary-software-tax to get it. (windows-preinstalled will have a slight added cost)  You can choose a different style laptop. I found my white polycarbonate/plastic macbook to be very uncomfortable, the speakers sucked, loud fan @ high CPU, and the plastic was cheap/got dirty.  Basically, be ready to get angry at design-over-functionality choices that Apple makes. At least the MBP doesn't have speakers right in the fan bay ><)  UI Customization.  Using Linux, you can literally make your user interface how you want it.  Things like OpenBox and more allow you to fine tune your experience.  Even windows has applications that let you modify your UI (to a degree).  As of the last time I used OSX, you basically have to suck up the way Apple decides to design your UI.  Software!. Running an ubuntu system, you can install software over the interwebs with ease using Package Managers. (Fink for Mac will do this too, not sure how well it works with everything though).  You can dual boot w/Linux or Windows, and even create a hackintosh.  I've seen OSX running well on a netbook. Nuff said.      In sum, and as some others have mentioned, buy a Mac if you NEED a mac(and, of course, if you really like the feel of the laptops/ui/etc).  Either way, you should choose what makes you enjoy your computer, whether that be spending less, having tons of choices, or purchasing for proprietary software and fancy/trendy looks.

Let's look at what we have:   C G A Bb   I'm assuming the C is the bass note. It would  be a stretch to call this any type of C chord because not only is there no 3rd, but there is also no 2nd or 4th. There is very rarely a chord with an omitted 3rd that is not suspend.(Besides a power chord which this is not.)  If we look at this chord as some kind of A chord it makes much more sense because we can stack the chord in thirds now and have it make sense:  A C _ G Bb  We still have no 5th, but the 5th is commonly omitted in larger chords.  A to C makes a minor 3rd, the G is a minor 7th and the Bb is a b9. Because the C is in the bass, we will have to notate the chord in slash notation so we get:  Am7b9/C  Still a lengthy name, but it describes the function of the chord better than C13 no 3, 9, 11 where it is very odd to omit 3 notes in a chord.   Another thing to note is it is typical in a 13th chord to omit the 9th and 11th as they are optional. So the suggested name could be reduced to C13 no 3, but still it is odd to omit a 3rd without some kind of sus.  ",1
"offload work to the RDBMS [SEP] do it in code [SEP] You want to do all set-based operations in the database for performance reasons. So aggregation functions, sorting functions, joins etc.   This age calculation, I'd do in code. The only reason I might ever do something like this in a database query is if it required lots of columns that I wouldn't otherwise select that could actually amount to enough data to meaningfully slow down my query. Selecting a few integer values will not make a meaningful performance difference. And even if it makes a moderate performance difference I will be biased towards keeping this logic in the application code.  ",0
"Low-quality paper [SEP] no paper [SEP] If the quality of the work is low, the student should neither publish it in a lower tier conference nor publish it as a technical report.  They should either make the time to improve it or toss it in the trash.  A bad publication, no matter what venue it's published in, is worse than no publication at all.  Similarly, a ""publication"" listed in a CV or described in a statement of purpose that isn't retrievable via google (unlike most technical reports, which are googlable) is also worse than no publication at all, because we can't tell if the applicant is lying.  (Sadly, some applicants are lying.)  ",0
"to book Dutch train tickets online in advance [SEP] to paying on the day [SEP] With regular NS trains (intercity's, sprinter's and stoptrains) booking in advance does not give you any discount. If you would travel with a NS HiSpeed train this could be the case, but there's no direct HiSpeed connection between Eindhoven and Amsterdam, so it's irrelevant to your journey.  There's a direct train between Eindhoven and Amsterdam Central Station which would cost you €17.90 one way. If you buy the ticket at the counter, instead of at the machine, you'll have to pay an additional €0.5.  If you're really tight on money you could look for someone who looks like a student and ask politely if you can travel ""together"". 90% off all students has a card which gives them and 3 fellow travellers a 40% reduction on any train journey. Fellow travellers can make use of this system after 09:00 on weekdays, the whole day during weekends and also the whole day during the months July and August.  When I was a student I've had this question asked several times. When a conductor asked the other person why he had a ticket with 40% discount, I would just say that we travelled together, making the discounted ticket valid.  ",1
"Star free language [SEP] regular language [SEP] Regular languages are those that can be described by weak monadic second order logic (WMSO) [1].  Star-free languages are those that can be described by first order logic with $<$ (FO[<]) [2].  The two logics are not equally powerful. One example for a language that is WMSO-definable but not FO[<]-definable is $(aa)^*$ (which is clearly regular³); this can be shown using Ehrenfeucht-Fraissé games⁴.      Weak Second-Order Arithmetic and Finite Automata by Büchi (1960)  Counter-free automata by McNaughton and Papert (1971)  A WMSO-formula for $(aa)^*$ is   $\ \begin{align}          \bigl[ \forall x.

"to play the keyboard standing [SEP] sitting [SEP] It will always be easier to sit and operate pedals - the required uneven shift in weight from one foot to the other and holding it for extended periods can become quite tiring.  If your biggest concern is how it looks to the audience then yes, you'll probably have to put up with the discomfort and awkward stance of standing but there are a couple of things you can do to help:    Make sure the keyboard is set at a comfortable height (certainly don't leave it at sitting height!) and place the pedals relative to your playing position such that you don't have to lean excessively to operate them. If they're too far forward, you'll find yourself leaning backwards.  Use a bar stool or similar behind you to 'lean' against. That way, you can appear to be standing but you also have the support of a seat. Make sure it's sturdy and not on a slippery floor, else it may let you down when you come to rely on it!  If you're using a volume/expression pedal, get a 'balanced' one that holds its position so you don't have to keep your foot on it unless you're moving it.    ",1
"the string [SEP] the body [SEP] On an electric guitar, the construction of the body is of limited importance. At the high end of the market, people worry about the tonal qualities of various kinds of wood, but for the most part, we worry about an electric guitar body being as rigid as possible, and the pickups are where most of the character comes from.  On an acoustic guitar, the construction of the guitar itself has the most impact on its sound. You are hearing the vibration of the sound board, so what's important is the frequencies that are absorbed or reinforced by the way the body vibrates, and the way the bridge transmits vibration from the string to the body.  You can put great strings on a bad acoustic guitar, and it will still sound bad.  How do you know a guitar is good quality? Use your ears. If you can't hear the difference, the difference isn't important!  However, one rule of thumb is that plywood is the mark of a cheap guitar. You can recognise plywood by looking at the sound hole -- you can see the layers. You get a significant step up in tone from a solid wood sound board.   ",1
"en_US [SEP] en_GB [SEP] International APIs  APIs which are intended to be international use EN-US. So if your intent is to provide your API to the developers worldwide (or at least several countries where British English is not commonly used), you should use EN-US.  Local APIs  Of course, small APIs which are targeting precise country can be in the language of this country. But think twice about using EN-GB even in this case:    Living in France, I would personally not appreciate an API en French; English is just easier to use when it comes to development. Locale settings make it just weird to write in local language. If you've seen source code with Chinese, German or Russian names of methods, you'll understand why. What I currently see here too often is the source code which mix French names with accents (é, ê, à, etc.), French names without accents (which is completely wrong and can be misleading), English names, and misspelled English).  Using EN-GB can make it more difficult to use the API even for British developers. It's difficult to remember that we must write Color in C# or in PHP, but Colour in a specific API.  When creating a local API, can you be sure that it will not be famous on international level in one, two or ten years?    ",0

"to dual-boot [SEP] run a VM [SEP] Dual boot is a waste of time. I describe it to people as ""the 5-minute alt-tab"". It's a pain to configure, and because you can't run both OSes at once, when you need the one you're not running, you have to kill off every app and reboot.  I avoid dual boot like the plague. VM all the way.  Or, just use a single OS that does what you want. Windows with Cygwin provides a lot of the Unixy stuff that most people need.  ",0
"RIA Services [SEP] CSLA [SEP] I have recently been working on some line-of-business Silverlight projects.  For one we used straight WCF and did all the CRUD, state tracking, entity relationship, etc. ourselves.  For the second project we are using RIA Services and had it manage all of that stuff for us.  However, we did NOT have RIA Services directly generate services based on our ORM model.  We had a layer of interfaces and ""dumb objects"" in between.  So we had a distinct data tier, business logic tier, and service tier.  RIA Services was only involved at the service tier.  If you are going to use RIA Services, I recommend limiting how much of the layers of your application you let it influence.  It does force you down certain paths as far as design is concerned, so the more you contain it the more flexibility you will have.  This advice is probably sound for CSLA as well.  If you are going to ""bet"" on a particular framework, hedge your bet as much as possible.  In summary, RIA Services will definitely save you time, but it does limit your flexibility a bit compared with raw WCF.  And it has some kinks and weaker areas that still need improvement.  I haven't worked with CSLA, but I have seen Rocky Lhotka give talks on it several times so I know the basics.  It seems like a solid framework.  However, the main disadvantage it will have compared with RIA Services is that it isn't directly from Microsoft, so CSLA won't mesh as cohesively with other MS stuff as much as RIA Services will.  Also, in the long run I'm guessing it will be easier to find people that know RIA Services versus people that know CSLA.  If it helps, I gave a talk on RIA Services you can find the presentation and some sample code on my blog.  [REF]  ",0
"preheat a pan [SEP] start the cooking timer immediately [SEP] If you cook (or bake) using a timer, you should always use preheated equipment.  Your stove top may differ from my stove top in terms of the length of time it would take to get to high heat (hell, my stove top wouldn't even hit high heat in three minutes), and this would greatly effect the final quality.  Always preheat, the instructions expect it.  Otherwise, it would tell you to put a pan on the stove top, place in pan, and turn on to high heat.  Leave for three minutes and remove.  ",0
"Installer [SEP] Portable [SEP] It depends on your target audience.  As a programmer or a power user, I like my software to be inside a compressed file for portability and to be able to just delete the software without having to worry about it leaving any traces in the registry.  As a regular person (mostly applies to regular Windows users), however, I just want to click setup.exe and have it install itself for me. I don't want to have to bother looking at a README file or following some other form of instruction just to install the software that I want. Don't make me click any more than I could handle.  You should consider who you're making the software for first before deciding whether to make an installer or not.  ",1

"Sight Read [SEP] Memorising [SEP] Sorry for the obvious answer here, but though everyone has strengths and weakness, you do get better at what you practice well and after 20-30 years of practice, your skills reflect first what you worked on most.    In this bunch, I am good at sight reading, good at reading notes, can    only memorise with both hands; bad at rhythm, bad at memorising.    One possible explanation among others to your situation:  The memory most people have (and the first to go away when under stress) is finger memory. It comes from playing the piece over and over and doesn't require much understanding of the piece.  If you are good at sight reading, chances are you quickly play hands together and thus acquire that finger memory. And chances are also that you rely on the music sheet heavily (since you read well) and don't have to challenge your memory.   Bad at memorizing can mean many things: that it goes away with stress, that it takes a long time to come to you, etc.  Take a short piece and explore a different approach: practice it diligently with hands separately for a much longer time; try to play it from memory after just a few passes, even if you don't know it yet; then as you start playing it from memory, start randomly from anywhere in the piece, and chances are that you will find yourself having a very strong memorization for that piece, pretty quickly, playing it with both hands or only one hand.  My point here being that even though everyone has different inherent skill, I suspect that a lot of what you consider as a given comes from your playing habits.  ",1
"0 [SEP] 5 [SEP] Advantages of RAID 5 in your setup:    You can add disks to increase the storage without having to reinstall the operating system or recover data.  RAID 5 is fault tolerant.  You are very very unlikely to have more than one disk fail at the same time (although I did just see this for the first time at a client - gulp), so there is much less chance of having to rebuild your system from scratch  If a disk fails with RAID 5, you can simply replace the disk and rebuild/resync the array.  If a single disk fails with RAID 0, bye bye data on both disks.  If you were to stick with RAID 0 and a daily backup, restoring from the backup would result in data loss between when the last backup was taken and when the disks failed.    Disadvantages of RAID 5 in your setup:    There is a performance hit when writing, over a RAID 0 striped array.  You need at least 3 disks.  You effectively lose the capacity of one of the disks (although the parity data is spread across all disks).    RAID 5 is common for business servers that hold mission critical data and require maximum uptime.  Otherwise, if speed is the dominating requirement in your setup and a loss of maybe a few hours work is acceptable, then go for RAID 0.  ",1
"rain water [SEP] tap water [SEP] Your tap water will have particular properties depending on where you live, the source of your water, and whether you have some sort of water softener or filtering system. My tap water, for example, is from the public system and is considered 'hard' because it has a high mineral (calcium and/or magnesium) content.  If I use tap water consistently on certain plants, I can see white rings of calcium deposits sitting on the soil surface; this can change the chemical properties - such as the pH - of the soil which can affect plant growth. Softened water has higher levels of salt than plants prefer, and these salts can build up in the soil. I've never seen the chlorine in public water causing any ill effects on my plants, but if you have sensitive house-plants you can let chlorine-treated water sit out for 24 hours to let the chlorine evaporate. As long as you live in an area that isn't subject to extremely acidic rain, rainwater is preferable because it's missing things like excessive minerals or disinfectant chemicals.    ",0
"JFK [SEP] EWR [SEP] Personally I prefer United to American though American is now trying to get more competitive while trying to merge.  Now here for some pros and cons:  Infant Friendliness  This has been discussed on the forum ad nauseam so I won't repeat this but just refer you to the question asked previously on this forum: US to Asia via Europe with infants  One thing that I would add to the information provided there is that American Airline is now going through Restructuring and a Merger with US Airways, this usually entails layoffs during consolidation, so this always weighs on employees minds, and while they are likely to keep being professional ""Freudian slips"" are more likely to happen.  Also I don't see Alex Cross any more on the list of movies available from United.  Airport Convenience and Professionalism  I can't say anything about the differences in personnel behavior because I haven't found any.  Friendliness is about the same in both(I am yet to find any), but the information is will be provided on what you need and you will be directed to where you need to go.  As far as baggage handling is concerned and speed of clearing border control and customs I would say it's about the same.  Personally I prefer Newark to JFK for location convenience but since you are only planning to stay the night and leave it won't matter much to you.  Quality of Surrounding Hotels  Depends entirely on your price range.  There are hotels like Sheraton, Hilton and Marriott, to Courtyard, DoubleTree, and Hilton Garden, to HoJo, Days Inn and Ramada, to no-name motels like JFK Inn, around both airports, so the choice is yours.  I would suggest picking it ahead of time and making reservations so you won't have to wait at the airport a long time for a pick up by a courtesy shuttle, which hotel normally provides for you.  Hotels around JFK will be slightly more expensive since they are located inside the New York City limits and also will carry higher taxes on the Rooms.  HOTELS AMENDMENT  Since your price range is < $200 total you're probably going to cover most hotels with ease.  Not being in the path of planes landing or taking off would be a little harder especially in JFK where depending on prevailing winds planes can land coming over the city to runway 22R.  So you need to be away from the glide path which means that your choices might be limited to: Days Inn, Best Western, Holiday Inn Express, Comfort Inn, HoJo, JFK Inn, and a couple of others.  Noise situation is better in Newark where hotels except for Marriott are located far enough away from the airport and away from glide paths I have stayed in a Courtyard on Frontage road and in EconoLodge on Route 1 and it's pretty quiet with reasonable prices but you can pick your as choices are plentiful.
