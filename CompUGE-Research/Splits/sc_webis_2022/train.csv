"to refer to subplots as a ""frame"" [SEP] a ""panel"" [SEP] I can't recall having seen the word frame or panel used to refer to a subplot. More commonly:  In the text, e.g.,    Figure 1(a) shows [...]; figure 1(b), instead, shows [...].    In the caption, e.g.,    Figure 1. Comparison among blah blah: (a) function f [...]; (b) function g [...]    ",2
"nVidia GTS240/250 [SEP] ATI HD4870 [SEP] This article treats how the GTS 250 stacks against the Radeon HD 4870 (and others).  It contains this comparison chart that tells you everything technical that you ever wanted to know and were afraid to ask about.  More importantly, it contains detailed performance analysis for different screen resolutions in the section First-Person 3D Shooters. My personal conclusion is that performance-wise there are only slight differences between the models. Which probably means that the lower model of GTS 240 is inferior to the Radeon.  ",0
"dictionaries [SEP] databases [SEP] If you want to know whether there is a performance advantage, the best thing to do is measure it yourself. The performance depends a lot on the type of data, the language, the amount of data, etc.   It's impossible to give a blanket statement as to when dictionaries are better than databases. Again, it depends on the data, the language, etc. Roughly speaking, dictionaries are better for simple and small datasets, and databases are good for complex and large data sets.  ",1
"job experience [SEP] taking more courses [SEP] If the ""job experience provider"" would write a good recommendation for you afterwards (surely you must also deserve it), this may matter more.   Unless you skip some very basic course that your future company sees as very useful for your work. For example, if the future company focuses on C++ development, a course with good marks in C++ programming may matter more than work in some company that required HTML/CSS only.   I would say, take that job but think well which course deserves dropping most of all.  ",0
"Devil's Food [SEP] Chocolate cake [SEP] PracticallyEdible has a nice description of Devil's Food Cake.  Originally, Devil's Food Cake had a medium dense texture.  The colour had a reddish tint that was probably caused by baking soda reacting with cocoa powder.  In fact, I have an old cookbook (The Day by Day Cook Book, 1939) that contains a recipe for Red Devil's Food Cake.  This recipe calls for 2 oz. unsweetened chocolate and 1 tsp. of baking soda.  ",1
32 [SEP] 64 bit [SEP] You should install 64-bit linux. Even though there are ways for the 32-bit kernel to address more than 4 GB the applications will still have a 3 GB limit.   ,0
"trivial [SEP] non-trivial software [SEP] I'm going to go out on a limb here and say:    A trivial program is one that does not directly impact the business.    A manufacturing firm would consider its accounting software trivial, but the software that controls the robotic arm that moves boiling steel is critical. They can deal with bugs and low support turnaround in the former, but not it the latter. If there's an issue, they need it fixed now.  ",2
"Stay at the airport [SEP] spend a few hours in Panama City [SEP] It is a bit of a drive (probably around 30-45 minutes, as you said), and as far as I know there is no public transport so you have to get a taxi (about $30 one way). However, you have 8 hours, so you are still left with 5 hours in Panama City. If I were you, I would definitely go for it. For example, you would manage to see all of the  Casco Viejo and have a nice lunch there.  ",0
"VISE [SEP] InstallerMaker [SEP] Use Package Maker from Apple.  It's free and is included with the Developers Kit from Apple.  I believe it will handle what issues you have, but if not check out LanRev Install Ease.    InstallVise is a pain for anyone that is trying to create a automated software clone.  PackageMaker & LanRev Install Ease will create Packages, which can contain multiple versions of your software, for multiple versions of the OS.  And they can be used in Apple's SUI, InstaDMG, and etc for Automated OS creation...  ",2
"to book a car rental in advance [SEP] once I'm in South Africa [SEP] It is definitely better to book a car in advance, even in lower season. I would not take the risk of arriving there and not finding a suitable car. Moreover, when you book your car at home you can rent it through a broker. This way you will get a good price. And I have some doubts that you will find a better deal by pounding the rental desks at O.R. Tambo airport.  ",0
"Minimalistic Linux [SEP] opensolaris HOST [SEP] If you want to build up a system with nothing more than you need, a ubuntu minimal  or debian minimal disk is a good start. then install vmware server (no idea if virtualbox runs headless)  If you want a dedicated VM server, ESXi would be worth trying (its free, BUT tends to be picky about the software it runs on) or microsoft hyper-v server (also free, but dosen't quite meet your specs - its windows server 2008 based).

"writing dvd's at a lower speed [SEP] Higher speed [SEP] It help a little, but I would also be aware that disk rotating at much lower speed is getting burned much more that designed and that can cause problems also. Higher speed DVDs have also more sensitive layer.  Best bet would be to leave it on auto since most (if not all) DVD writters test their burn intensity anyhow.  I assume that big part of you problem here is not writting speed but batch of bad DVD media.  ",1
"JSF [SEP] Wicket [SEP] Mostly the JSF hate blogs belong to 2009 and before, JSF 2.0 fixed many of the issues. I don't think it is popular just because of it's standard, remember that EJB 2.x was the standard then Spring came up. There are many web frameworks but JSF is still very popular. Also recent JSF Specs starting with 2.0 is designed according to user feedback acquired since JSF 1.x.  ",0
"Windows Live Movie Maker [SEP] Windows XP Movie Maker [SEP] One of the most noticable changes is the inclusion of the Ribbon menu system.  Also it's got built in features for uploading to popular video sites (i.e. YouTube). I just downloaded the new Movie Maker yesturday and I havn't had a chance to use it yet but I've read that it has new transitions, effects, and editing capabilities as well as additional video format supports.

"On-Screen Keyboards [SEP] a physical keyboard [SEP] The built-in on-screen keyboard that comes with many operating systems is designed to help people who are unable to use a physical keyboard because of disabilities. Due to this, an on-screen keyboard behaves as much like a real keyboard as possible and it's activity will most likely be logged by a keylogger.  On-screen keyboards specifically designed for security (on a bank's website, for example) are a different story and are likely more secure against keyloggers.  [REF]  ",0
"i7 920 [SEP] 940 processors [SEP] ""don't bother, not worth the extra cash"".  If coming off of anything less than two years old, you will notice that when you start up and run things, it will generally be quicker. Anything older than two years and everything will be noticeably quicker.  Between the 920 - 940, I cannot say that you will see any big performance gains. I use many CPUs on a daily basis, and for .5GHZ (within same generations) you really cannot tell many differences  ",1
"Save as you go [SEP] Save when you're done [SEP] If you need transactions in your application, you will need to offer some kind of explicit ""Save"" option.   If the applications don't need transactions, using a database (as opposed to, say, a NoSQL technology) may be redundant.  This also means that the ""Save"" operation should not be a method called on the mutated object.   It should be a method on the transaction object, or the session.   ",1
"research experience [SEP] a second Masters degree [SEP] The question is framed oddly.  A master's degree without research experience will probably kill your chances for PhD admission, at least into the top programs.  Here's a better framing: Is a second master's degree the best way to get more research experience?  Unfortunately, the answer depends on your personal situation.  If you're already doing active research with a strong possibility of formal publication, with well-known faculty collaborators who will write you strong letters of recommendation, then a second MS is probably not necessary.  If that doesn't describe your current research environment, a second MS might be the best way to find such an environment.  ",1
"document functions in the header file [SEP] the source file [SEP] My view...    Document how to use the function in the header file, or more accurately close to the declaration.  Document how the function works (if it's not obvious from the code) in the source file, or more accurately, close to the definition.    For the birds-eye thing in the header, you don't necessarily need the documentation that close - you can document groups of declarations at once.  Broadly speaking, the caller should be interested in errors and exceptions (if only so they can be translated as they propogate through the layers of abstraction) so these should be documented close to the relevant declarations.

"to ship bicycle from Egypt to Leipzig, Germany [SEP] to buy/rent one [SEP]   Rental prices are not designed for periods of more than a few days. It might be possible to negotiate a long-term price at a flexible rental business.  It's definitely possible to get a decent used bike for 50-100 EUR. There's a risk that it could be a stolen one, but almost none of running into problems, even if it is.  I'm pretty sure that shipping a bike from Germany to Egypt and back will cost more than 100 EUR.    ",0
"Gas [SEP] charcoal grille [SEP] There are many advantages to gas: better heat control, easier to clean, less potentially carcinogenic soot.  In my experience, the flavor that can be imparted by charcoal is superior, especially with good charcoal like that sold at Trader Joes.  However, I have not tried any of the wood slabs that are meant for use with grilling. Perhaps these have some effect on the difference.   ",0
".msi [SEP] .exe [SEP] Usually msi packages are provided for system administrators who would have the need to deploy the software to several terminals over a network.  The results are no different from using an executable, but msi packages sometimes do have additional options such as doing silent or pre-configured installs.  If you are not a system administrator, use the executable.  ",1
"to fly [SEP] take the train [SEP] A good resource for checking train connections is [REF] There are often good deals on Europe's high speed trains, though you might only get a good deal to the south of France, not all the way into Italy.  It will be hard to beat a budget flight. Obviously on journey time but also on cost. Book in time and your return journey can be as little as 40 pounds with Easyjet.  Still, on [REF] you can see that, apparently, you can get a roundtrip by train from London to Italy for as little as 115 pounds. It's a long journey, but it's a good price.  ",0
"Kolmogorov complexity [SEP] purposefully inefficient Turing machines [SEP] You are stating the theorem incorrectly. The theorem states that the Kolmogorov complexity is the same up to a constant for essentially optimal description languages, which are those in which you can describe running a Turing machine on an input $x$ using $|x| + O(1)$ bits. Given this definition, it is a simple matter of playing with definitions to see that all such description languages result in the same notion of Kolmogorov complexity, up to an additive constant.  ",1
"64-bit [SEP] 32-bit Version [SEP] I would go with 64-bit version in all cases except in these three cases:    If there are no drivers for your devices (some old printers, PIC programmers, etc...)  If you need program that cannot work on 64-bit (Windows Mobile SDK Cellular Emulator comes to mind)  If you have less than 2 GB of RAM (as suggested by jerryjvl :)).    In all other cases, go with 64-bit OS.  ",0
"doughnut [SEP] krapfen [SEP] There doesn't appear to be any difference. Wikipedia says ""In English-speaking countries, Berliners are usually called doughnuts and are usually filled with jam, jelly, custard or whipped cream"", and this page says ""The English translation of krapfen is cruller or doughnut"". There are so many variations of filling, topping, shape and so forth that it is hard to establish a single identity anyhow.  ",1
"a static factory method of the same class [SEP] a separate factory class with methods [SEP] The second one; the separate class.  That separate class should also have an interface. The reason is that this is the option that allows swapping the factory most easily, which is good for lowering coupling and for testability.  ",0
"imitation vanilla [SEP] true vanilla extract [SEP] Yes, you can detect the difference. How much of a difference will depend on the quality of both the imitation and of the real thing.  That said, it's difficult if not impossible for me to pick out the differences in baked goods. So I keep both around, and use the (much cheaper) imitation stuff for baking, and the real stuff for sauces, icing, custards, milkshakes, etc.  Incidentally... In a pinch, bourbon makes a half-decent substitute for vanilla.  ",1
"European white truffles [SEP] those from North America [SEP] I think the truffles that are exported are of better quality on average than what you'll find on the european market. I've never tried the american ones consciously (they're not imported to Europe as far as I know).  You could also take into account that the fresher the truffles are the better the quality, so in theory it would be better to eat american truffles in the USA and european truffles in Europe.  Given the mind boggling price differences and the supposed high quality of the stuff found in the forests in Oregon, you're likely going to be well off picking the local stuff.  ",0
"an Intel Celeron [SEP] Intel Pentium processor [SEP] Basically, The Pentium line is the mainstream performance chip, and it has many optimised routines built in that make certain tasks perform fast.  For a Celeron, they heavily cut costs and generally have less on board memory, and the result is a much cheaper chip that performs reasonably well (and generally at less power), but not as good as an equal ghz/mhz Pentium / Core 2 of the same generation.  You can't really compare different generation chips because after the Pentium 4 era, the mhz/ghz no longer really count as a comparison because there are so many other factors that determine speed (front side bus, on board memory, instruction sets e.t.c.)  ",1
"chef's knife [SEP] butcher's [SEP] As you can see here, you can do it with a chef's knife.  I think you must try to cut between bones or around them, not through them. Gristle shouldn't be a problem for your knife.  ",0
"the code [SEP] the design [SEP] I start with code. Separate design documents, if there are any, are as likely to be wrong or misconceived as not. So, i start by trying to trace some simple flow through the code; if it's a webapp, it could be a request or a sequence of requests, for instance. Once i've done that, i have a sort of skeleton to hang more understanding on. Then, i might go back and read designs or other documentation, but at that point, i have something concrete to relate them to, and to validate them with, so i can detect duff information. Or i might just carry on reading code, or test cases, etc.  ",0
to do sight-seeing in the morning [SEP] the afternoon [SEP] Since there is only eight hours of daylight in London in January I would suggest you take the afternoon class. If you take the morning class then most of the daylight hours will taken up studying inside. It is probably safer and more enjoyable to wander around an unfamiliar city during daylight.  For typical sunrise / sunset hourse see : Sunrise/Sunset Calendar  ,0
"a wilted salad [SEP] a massaged salad [SEP] I've only heard of massaging kale.  If you rub the greens together they get softer, darker and more tender and useable in a salad.  Never done it with anything else. Wilted is steamed or blanched greens. Wilting definitely changes the texture and can make the greens more palatable and less bitter.  I won't eat raw collards. I also always salt and squeeze my cooked spinach before using as it knocks out the bitterness.  ",1
"mince [SEP] dice [SEP] Mincing produces smaller, more irregularly-shaped items than dicing.    Dicing is generally uniform, usually 1/8 to 1/4 inch on all sides, kind of like a tiny cube.   The best way to explain the size difference is visually, check out this link for a great picture near the top.  ",1
binary trees [SEP] hashtables [SEP] Hash tables can only tell you if an element is present or not.   Here are somethings you can do with a binary tree that you can't do wiht a hash table.    sorted traversal of the tree  find the next closest element  find all elements less than or greater than a certain value    See this wikipedia article on K-d trees for an example of a real world data structure that makes use of the special properties of binary trees.  [REF]  ,0
"multiplication [SEP] 0 padding [SEP] I'm assuming that your numbers are in binary. In this case, 0 padding is shift left: x << 3 is the same as x * 0x08, where 0x08 (hex) is 1000 (binary).  Shifting is much simpler to implement in hardware and is generally more efficient. You could check by writing a short C program.  Note that there is one significant difference between shift left and multiplication. The former does not signal if there is an overflow error, whereas the latter will.  ",0
"to quote parts of the orginal work [SEP] paraphrase [SEP] It depends why you are quoting/paraphrasing.  Usually I structure my review in two parts. The first part summarizes the paper, the major contributions, and the high-level strengths and weaknesses of the submission. In this part I paraphrase. This shows the authors, and the editor, that I have read and understood the paper well enough to describe its ideas in my own words.  In the second part I get into the details, i.e. you forgot citation X, formula Y has an error, these sentences are confusing, etc. In this part I quote.  ",1
"Windows 7 + lang pack [SEP] national version [SEP] With Vista and above, there is no difference whatsoever. Localized national editions are just Windows 7 with preinstalled language pack.  However, I am not sure whether buying software in US is in accordance with importing laws of your country.  ",1
"testing [SEP] code review [SEP] Developer unit testing first, then code review, then QA testing is how I do it. Sometimes the code review happens before the unit testing but usually only when the code reviewer is really swamped and that's the only time he or she can do it.  ",0
/etc/bash.bashrc [SEP] ~/.bashrc [SEP] /etc/bash.bashrc applies to all users  ~/.bashrc only applies to the user in which home folder it is.  ,2
"a type C [SEP] F plug adapter [SEP] Both of them will be ok.   However, on my opinion, I would prefer type C, because it has more flexibility in using. Also type C can be used in a lot of countries. If you travel a lot it's a big advantage.  More information you may find here: [REF]  ",0
"Silverlight [SEP] flash [SEP] Wikipedia on Silverlight:    Microsoft Silverlight is a web application framework with a scope similar to Adobe Flash. Version 2, released in October 2008, brought additional interactivity features and support for .NET languages and development tools.    So basicly, it is a competitor to Flash that uses .NET languages and is more focused on developing interactive web applications, rather than animations and movies.  Currently, Silverlight is only available for Windows and OS X, but there is an open source implementation being developed by the Mono team entitled Moonlight.  ",1
"Razor [SEP] XSLT [SEP] I HAVE successfully used XSLT as a web presentation tier...  in 1999.  In the last 12 years, much better options have come along.  Do yourself a big favor, and use Razor.  It's a pleasure.  ",0
"electric stoves [SEP] gas stoves [SEP] Can I convince you that electric is better? No, I can't, because I don't think it is. The issue I have is related to how long it takes to warm up (and cool down). Electric cook tops just don't respond quickly. Little too hot? Too bad, nothing you can do about it (in time to save a dish that's starting to burn anyway). Not hot enough? Check back in 2 or 3 minutes. I find this particularly irritating when a recipe requires varying heats while cooking. Sorry I don't have better news for you.  ",0
"steel [SEP] ceramic knives [SEP] In general, ceramic knives are great for what they do, but too fragile to do everything.   They can shatter if dropped on a hard surface, and can easily get get notched on bone.  I use my ceramics exclusively for vegetables for that reason.    If you're strapped for funds, you really only need to by one expensive knife (a steel chef's knife or santoku), and one cheap one (a serrated knife for cutting bread).  After that, picking up knife skills is more important and will make your cooking better than any investment in more knives.  ",1
"use the channel volume [SEP] master volume [SEP] A possibly more direct method to solving your problem would be to use ""hot-plates"". If you're familiar with Paul Gilbert, he uses hot-plates to basically heat up the tubes of his amp to get the desired tone, without of course, increasing the volume.  You might be able to use something like this to help your situation.  To quote the description: ""It lets you get your amp's full of distortion at any volume.""  ",2
"teaching experience [SEP] participation in conferences [SEP] Where do you want to work? Research universities want people who do research, publish, go to conferences,  and can tolerably teach, in that order.  Small liberal arts colleges want people who can teach and who do enough research to keep up with the field.   These are rough generalizations. There's no right answer here.  ",1
"Minimize [SEP] Hide [SEP] ""Minimize"" minimizes the program to the dock where you can see a thumbnail of the program's window.  ""Hide"" hides the window without adding the program's thumbnail to the dock.  I will minimize a program if I need to get it out of the way for a few moments while I'll hide a program if I need it out of the way for an extended period of time.  Most of the time I will hide icons.  ",2
"Wireless PCI Card [SEP] Wireless Bridge [SEP] I purchased a wireless bridge for my desktop instead of a PCI card, since the cards weren't working well with Vista and Windows 7 (at least the ones I tried.) I have been extremely happy with the wireless bridge and haven't looked back since.  A wireless bridge is definitely the way to go for connecting a desktop to WiFi. Also, you can connect it to your XBox 360 or other networked devices too!  ",0
"C [SEP] C++ [SEP] My favorite reason for not using C++ is that C has a de facto standard ABI on most platforms.  In other words, because there's no name mangling, etc., you can usually link code compiled with two different C compilers.  With C++, good luck because you'lll need it.  ",0
"Square [SEP] Round Container [SEP] I can think of two reasons to prefer square containers :    They store in less space for the same volume, when you're dealing with dozens of them (as the smoothie shops likely are)  The key to a good blending is that the inside is not round -- you need baffles and such to keep the blender from forming a single, smooth vortex.  The square containers would help to make baffles more effective by providing larger areas with slower moving liquid away from the center of the vortex.    ",0
"creative & complex [SEP] simple and readable [SEP] Your second version IS far more simple and readable, and much better in every way. It's not creative or complex, but perfectly normal, straightforward code.  The only way in which it might confuse newbies is that it requires them to understand that complex boolean expressions are A) still expressions like any other and B) can be used wherever a boolean value is required, rather than just inside an if clause.  But this is something newbies really need to understand, so you should never let the possibility of someone not yet understanding it influence your code.  ",1
"Linux [SEP] Windows/Mac [SEP] Apparently, it's because Linux users want it that way:    The reason Linux isn’t shown above is that all of the feedback we’ve received so far indicates that Linux users would be happier with a theme that uses native GTK icons in the navigation toolbar, which rules out this type of customized visual treatment.

"Turkey [SEP] Bulgaria [SEP] I live in Turkey and travel to Bulgaria regularly. (~20 times now). My general idea would be that this might be easier to find in Bulgaria as long as you were in one of the major cities. Turkey doesn't seem to have this stuff just anywhere.  That being said, it's cheap-ish generic gear can be found at some major markets in Turkey, so I'd be inclined to hit up a few stores and pick something up before I hit the road.  ",0
"containers [SEP] in the ground [SEP] I've seen many citrus trees in pots.  In fact where I live that is all I see since they'd have to come inside during the winter.  I'd think that the trees would do fine in a pot.  If you get a decent size pot they will grow to fill that pot.    I'm not sure what you mean by stunted by being in a pot.  The tree size will be limited because of the pot, but if removed from the pot it should grow like normal.  So it will not be permanently affected.   ",0
"a good ground cover [SEP] lawn [SEP] I found it difficult to mark just one answer as correct because all are. I am providing my own answer for this question, but it's only more correct than earlier answers in that it's the best groundcover for my specific situation and location.  What I eventually went with (on professional advice) was creeping boobialla (Myoporum parvifolium) for its outstanding suitability for the climate, soil type and hardiness zone in which it will be planted.

"RSA [SEP] DSA [SEP] The GPG maintainers are thinking of changing the default to RSA (source: Dealing with weakness in SHA-1 [LWN.net]). So, it seems they think RSA is currently the better option (and they should know more about it than you or me).  ",0
Windows 7 [SEP] Windows XP [SEP] All the older computer i have running XP seem to run better with Windows 7.  These computers include:  P4 1.8 Ghz with HT and 1GB ram  Celeron 1.6 Ghz 1GB ram  Give it a try.  ,0
"Bruges [SEP] Ghent [SEP] Both cities are really interesting destinations. The question to distinct between the two is whether or not you like tourist spots. Bruges is the more touristic city of the two. Personally I would go ofr Ghent and do a day trip to Bruges. But the other way around is perfectly possible.   However if you really would like to escape the crowds, go to Lier or Hasselt. No tourists and really pearls to visit.  ",0
"university teaching [SEP] high school teaching experience [SEP] If there is an option definitely university teaching is more valuable as it is at the same level as the teaching you will experience while doing your degree. However, you should consider that PhD is a research-based degree and teaching obligation is not primary concern. So you might get the position without having any teaching experience and finally get your PhD being a year or so younger.     ",0
"drinking alcohol [SEP] pills [SEP] If you have no specific medical condition that would be exacerbated by anti-anxiety drugs, I'd say you should at least try them to see if they work well for you. Most of them don't have serious side effects if you don't take too many, or too often.  Excessive drinking has well-documented negative effects, among them the possibility of violent behaviour that can get you into really bad trouble (as in: gigantic fines/damages, or even jail time) on a plane.

"milk powder [SEP] fresh milk [SEP] Poaching is a gentle process - the milk isn't boiling so there is no risk of it burning or the like. It will of course not spoil in the sense of it going off, that's a totally different process.  Fresh milk is better because, well, it's fresh. Powdered milk would probably work, but if you have fresh, use that.  ",0
"Gaussian Blur [SEP] Down Sampling [SEP] Down sampling may discard relevant features, while blurring should not.  As a toy example, a down sample may remove a pixel which is a local maxima, while a blur operation will preserve the maxima by increasing the values of nearby pixels. If the local maxima corresponds to an interesting feature, it may still be discernible by the human eye after blurring.  From a computational sense, Laplacian pyramids are able to reconstruct an image precisely because a blur-subtract operation preserves the ""information"" in the scene.  ",0
"Integer Linear Programming [SEP] Mixed Integer Linear Programming [SEP] Knowing that integer programming (ILP) is NP-complete, it follows that mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is NP-complete too as MILP generalizes ILP.  My guess is that your thinking and feeling comes from insufficient testing: you don't have enough test cases with different structure, and you don't mention what algorithms you use. Even though both problems are hard, there are (even exact) algorithms that perform well on suitably structured instances. You should look at where the really hard instances are (they are not necessarily large), and try running your algorithms again.  ",1
"to use a Database [SEP] a data structure [SEP] If you can fit everything into available memory why not use one of the many Hash map libraries/templates available for C/C++.  You will get a massive performance boost (no disks, no IO, no parsing no .....) and most of the APIs available are pretty simple to use.  Have a look at this comparison to see which one would best suit your needs.  ",1
"to pick herbs from the top [SEP] bottom of the plant [SEP] I would take basil by pinching whole stems off. The new growth is the best tasting and the plant will sprout multiple new stems from the old one. You have to be careful not to overdo it which is why you might want more than one plant to produce enough basil on a regular basis. Most herbs will respond to this treatment, I can't think of any exceptions, but I am sure there are some.  ",2
"functionality [SEP] design [SEP] Functionality  Design can come later, core functionality is key to a deliverable product.  Disregarding design, the key is to get a deliverable functioning product out the door sooner rather then later. Design is a secondary objective. If you can't make it work, then all the flowers and pretty colors won't save you. Having a working product, with minimal design work will.  Perfectly adhering to a pattern or OOP principals are great, but often you will find that for the sake of producing something that works they will have to be ignored in some cases.   ",0
"comfort [SEP] teamwork [SEP]   Get some chat software installed    Aside from that you may find some of the other developers find verbal communication breaks them out of the productive 'zone', regardless of how work related the talk is.

"key-value [SEP] subject-predicate-object [SEP] Following your simplicity argument (binary is more fundamental than octal), I'd say that key-value stores are more fundamental.  I think that Subject-Predicate is essentially a 'compound' or 'aggregate' key, so a subject-predicate-object store is a key-value store with additional requirements on the key (namely that it can be split into two).

"to cut [SEP] tear basil leaves [SEP] Tearing is for artistic effect  Some people will claim tearing does not damage the cell of the plant as much as cutting, a simple look under a basic microscope will show you otherwise. Not sure how this would affect basil in particular. What dish are you preparing?  If you want more basil flavour and smell, cut it more finely, or bruise it (back of knife or rolling pin) to release more oils just before serving  ",0
"Westell [SEP] Linksys [SEP] I've had a Westell 7500 for one day, and so far, I don't like it.  One workaround that I have discovered for DynDNS:  If you use Mac OS X, there is a DynDNS widget that will update DynDNS for you.  [REF]  ",0
"LISP's macro [SEP] Ruby's ""ability"" to create DSL [SEP] Read On Lisp and then decide for yourself.  My summary is that Ruby is better at providing convenient syntax.  But Lisp wins, hands down, at the ability to create new abstractions, and then to layer abstraction on abstraction.  But you need to see Lisp in practice to understand that point.  Hence the book recommend.  ",1
"Waiting once at startup for a long time [SEP] waiting frequently for a short time [SEP] Startup as fast as possible, use a thread to do the most important calculations. So the user gets a feedback immediately, and can start working after 15 secs. In the background, let another thread calculate everything, so after two minutes, those 2-3 sec response times also go away.  ",0
"Low-quality paper [SEP] no paper [SEP] If the quality of the work is low, the student should neither publish it in a lower tier conference nor publish it as a technical report.  They should either make the time to improve it or toss it in the trash.  A bad publication, no matter what venue it's published in, is worse than no publication at all.  Similarly, a ""publication"" listed in a CV or described in a statement of purpose that isn't retrievable via google (unlike most technical reports, which are googlable) is also worse than no publication at all, because we can't tell if the applicant is lying.  (Sadly, some applicants are lying.)  ",0
"an open-ended ticket [SEP] a one-way ticket [SEP] Even if flexible return tickets are more expensive, it could be cheaper than two One-Way tickets, due to the way how airlines calculate their OW fares. You could also try to get a good fare which is not completely restricted (e.g. changing the date for a fee like 100$), which could still be cheaper than flexible ones, even if you add the fee.  ",1
"frying [SEP] baking meatballs [SEP] No recipe alteration needed.  Fried meatballs will develop more of a crust, and thus more flavour through the Maillard reaction. In any case, unless you're making tiny meatballs (or finishing their cooking in a sauce of some sort), they're going to need to be finished via baking anyway.  I would only do the baking method if I had to make an enormous quantity at once. For home cooking I always fry then bake.  ",2
"institution [SEP] specialization [SEP] If your interest is in ""industry,"" I'd choose a school based on the institution. Most employers look at that as the ""headline,"" and often ""gloss over"" the actual content of the degree.  If your interest was in research, I'd go the other way and emphasize ""specialization."" Because that is what research is basically about.  ",1
"using a dedicated rice cooker [SEP] cooking rice in a pot [SEP] Yes there are benefits! This is one of my most used pieces of kitchen equipments. Here is a list of benefits for a quality rice cooker:    Never burns rice  No guess measurements for all kinds of rice  Scheduled cooking  Keep warm settings  Uniform cooking    When I cook rice on my stove, even at the lowest of heats, I get a thin layer of rice that has overcooked stuck to the bottom of the pot.  For the record I have the Zojirushi 5-1/2 cup induction rice cooker. Best thing ever.  ",0
"SSD [SEP] Superfetch [SEP] I doubt that RAM is the bottleneck, unless you are running multiple VMs or something like that.  Read/write speeds are most likely the bottleneck on any modern machine, so getting a faster drive is usually the best solution.  ",0
"""deadlock prevention"" [SEP] ""deadlock avoidance"" [SEP] It seems that deadlock prevention and deadlock avoidance are two names for the same concept. Indeed, the Wikipedia section on deadlock avoidance has been marked as redundant. While the distinction might be taken from the literature, some people at least are arguing that this distinction is superfluous. See the paper The classification of deadlock prevention and avoidance is erroneous by Neumann Levine, which is mentioned in the Talk part of the Wikipedia article.  ",1
"Turing machines [SEP] pushdown automata [SEP] If you only consider that 'Turing machines can always be made to behave like a stack' you can only conclude that they are at least as powerful as pushdown automata.  But in general, yes it is true, Turing machines are more powerful than PDAs. The easiest example would be to show that Turing machines can describe Context Sensitive Languages.  ",0
"a BSc at a top-ranked university [SEP] a MComp at a lower-ranked university [SEP] If you can attend a top university, do so.  Having other excellent students around can provide a much better learning environment--to the point that in three years at a top place you may learn as much as in four years at a more mediocre institution.  If you do well, you can always do another one or two years of graduate study after your bachelor's degree.   ",0
"light rosin [SEP] dark rosin [SEP] The answer may surprise you:      colour    Really, it gives you the option to avoid light coloured rosin dust on your instrument. Useful if you have a very dark instrument.   ",1
"Intel Celerdon D 351 3.2Ghz [SEP] AMD Athlon 64 3200+ [SEP] the Athlon 64 3200+ is the better performer of the two (by a far cry).  SuperPi (1m calcs): 44 sec vs 71 sec  even the Sempron 3200 (AMDs low cost counterpart to Intel's Celeron series) beats the the Celeron D351 by almost 30% in benchmarks, it certainly is no match for the Athlon with its 512 L2 cache.
