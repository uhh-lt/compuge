"What's the better way to charge for a cloud platform, simple but more expensive, or complicated but cheaper for most?","Like all good questions, the answer depends. It depends on your application: Is it something you are likely going to be using periodically? A lot on some days of every month and very little the rest of the month? Once a year? Then a pay-as-you-go model would be 'nicer'.  It also depends on the sophistication of your users. Will they bother to do the mental arithmetic if you explain the PAYG model to them? Will they care?  How much will your users be spending? $5? $10? They might simple not care for that amount of money to optimize their experience and would probably rather go for something that is simple or easy.   Could the two models make a differences as large as $1000? Then you might find people are more than willing to have a look at the PAYG terms...  ",1,simple but more expensive,complicated but cheaper
When is it better to offload work to the RDBMS rather than to do it in code?,"You want to do all set-based operations in the database for performance reasons. So aggregation functions, sorting functions, joins etc.   This age calculation, I'd do in code. The only reason I might ever do something like this in a database query is if it required lots of columns that I wouldn't otherwise select that could actually amount to enough data to meaningfully slow down my query. Selecting a few integer values will not make a meaningful performance difference. And even if it makes a moderate performance difference I will be biased towards keeping this logic in the application code.  ",2,offload work to the RDBMS,do it in code
"I believe my solution is better than my boss's, so should I ignore him?","Having been ""the boss"" and, as it turned out, actually better than my staff in all cases bar one - yes, he will be mad - or annoyed or frustrated and in any case, quite possibly, right in the first place.  If you're genuinely better than him then you should be able to understand his proposed solution and to see why yours is better and then to explain why.   But you state:    because his idea was not clear enough to me    In which case you need to go back and understand what he wants and why and whether - as has been the case both in me making suggestions to my staff and my staff proposing solutions to me - you or he has missed something. But don't assume that he's wrong and you're right unless and until you understand what he's asking for and whether he's covering something you haven't thought of (yet).

"Is it better to have C developers learn Flash, than hire Flash guys?","It would matter a great deal why the existing C developers re-wrote all the code.  On the one hand, it could be that an architect needs to determine what functionality needs to be built in the different software tiers.  If you are embedding logic in Flash that needs to be reused by your C developers, for example, that's probably a poor architecture and could explain why the C developers needed to rewrite the code to pull out various APIs.  On the other hand, it could be that your existing developers are being excessively territorial and resistant to learning a new language.  On the third hand, perhaps Flash was a poor technology choice for the requirements you have and the frameworks that have to be leveraged.  Without addressing why the previous projects failed with the members of the team and with the stakeholders, it's going to be very hard to address the problem.

Is it better to document functions in the header file or the source file?,"My view...    Document how to use the function in the header file, or more accurately close to the declaration.  Document how the function works (if it's not obvious from the code) in the source file, or more accurately, close to the definition.    For the birds-eye thing in the header, you don't necessarily need the documentation that close - you can document groups of declarations at once.  Broadly speaking, the caller should be interested in errors and exceptions (if only so they can be translated as they propogate through the layers of abstraction) so these should be documented close to the relevant declarations.

Easy going advisor versus expert advisor and research experience,"How you approach the professor for acceptance would be very similar to how you speak to your current advisor (should you choose to*) about your decision:    Be objective, there is no need to mention anything about either academic in a personal way, this decision is purely one for an academic reason - you want to be 'closer' to where current active research is happening and amongst those actively involved in research in your field.  Related, be polite and direct to the point.    The fact that the professor has expressed interest in writing a paper with you is a strong indication - perhaps accept this offer and at that stage mention that you wish to pursue your research under his guidance and to work within his labs.

Low-quality paper or no paper - which is better for an undergraduate in PhD admission?,"If the quality of the work is low, the student should neither publish it in a lower tier conference nor publish it as a technical report.  They should either make the time to improve it or toss it in the trash.  A bad publication, no matter what venue it's published in, is worse than no publication at all.  Similarly, a ""publication"" listed in a CV or described in a statement of purpose that isn't retrievable via google (unlike most technical reports, which are googlable) is also worse than no publication at all, because we can't tell if the applicant is lying.

What is the difference between research intensive vs. research extensive universities?,"""Research intensive"" and ""research extensive"" are obsolete terms from the Carnegie classification of research universities.  They are terrible, confusing terms that should never have been introduced (see page 5 of Rethinking and reframing the Carnegie classification).  The idea was that ""research extensive"" means there's an extensive research program covering many areas at a high level, which ""research intensive"" means there's just a narrowly focused, intensive research program in certain areas.  Basically, extensive is supposed to be better than intensive.  Of course the problem is that this really isn't what they sound like.  For example, most people would say Harvard is a research intensive university, but in this classification it's not.  Because of massive confusion, the Carnegie classification was updated to use other terms, but the old terms still persist.  One reason is that some people just got used to them and found it hard to develop new habits; another is that every time the classification changes, some universities end up moving to a less prestigious category than they used to be in, so they have a strong incentive to describe themselves using the old terms.

Differences in student load at liberal arts colleges vs. research universities,"You are making several unfounded assumptions:    That courses are always 3 credits, so that ""4 courses per semester"" means 12 credits. I have taken courses that were worth 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 credits. Many of the science courses I've taken, including math and computer science courses, have been worth 4 credits. Basic sciences that involve a lecture, lab, and recitation have sometimes been 5 credits.  That most liberal arts colleges follow the LACS recommendations to the letter.   That the LACS recommendations somehow suggest that less than 120 credits are required for graduation. Here is an example of a liberal arts college following the LACS recommendations for CS and requiring 120 credits.     I did half of my undergraduate degree at a liberal arts college and then transferred to a large research university for the other half. There was virtually no difference in my courseload between the two - I took exactly one credit more in my two years in the research university.

What are the trade-offs of working in the office versus elsewhere (as a professor)?,"I think it's important to set boundaries with students, with colleagues, and with yourself about when and where you're available for meetings.  It's also important to find environments that most effectively support different types of work, and give yourself permission to use them.  Like you, when I'm in my office, I expect to be interrupted; so when I'm working at my desk, I can only productively work on tasks that survive interruption.  Put bluntly, the office is where I have meetings; if I need to think, I find a whiteboard in an empty conference room; if I need to write, I go to a coffee shop.  (Suresh is correct; I am in a coffee shop right now.)  As Daniel says, all three places allow for productive work, but of very different types.  Even in the computer science building, for small meetings where I don't want to be interrupted, I prefer to go to the other person's office.  And because my undergraduate office hours are occasionally very popular (especially right before exams), I don't hold them in my actual office, but in a larger room down the hall with couches and whiteboards.  You express two points of concern, which I'll exaggerate:    My students won't like me if I'm not available on their schedule.  I agree with DQdlM and Nate.  Spread out your office hours to fit as many students' schedules as possible, be in your office (or ""office"") for every minute of office hours even if nobody shows up, and be willing to offer occasional off-schedule meetings.  It might help to announce in your syllabus times that you're willing to schedule sporadic meetings.  (""I'm also available for occasional meetings Tuesday or Thursday afternoons; send me email to set up an appointment!"")  Consider moving (not adding) your office hours if student demand doesn't match your announced schedule.  But then stick to your guns.  Yes, some students will be unhappy, but that's inevitable; don't take it personally.  Your availability outside regular office hours will not be the most significant bit in your student evaluations.  My colleagues won't like me if they don't see me in my office.  I agree with DQdlM and Suresh here.  Yes, it's important to be visible and active citizen of your department; that's not the same thing as being constantly on call.  The amount of time you spend at your desk will not be the most significant bit in your tenure evaluation.  The danger is not that nobody sees you in your office, but that nobody knows what you're doing.  Give regular talks to your colleagues and their PhD students showing off the results of your out-of-office effort.  Go to faculty meetings, and occasionally offer an opinion.  (Careful, that gun is loaded.)  Attend seminars, especially for faculty candidates, and ask questions.  If there is a regular departmental social event (""Tea"" in many math departments), be there.  And so on.    Finally, I strongly encourage you to raise these concerns with your department chair or your senior faculty mentors.  (You do have a senior faculty mentor, don't you?  If not, find one!)  They can help you navigate your department culture far better than Some Guy On The Intertubes.  ",0,working in the office,elsewhere
Which is more important for PhD applicants — Quality or quantity of research papers?,"I disagree with the assumption that top journals with slow turnaround times are more highly regarded than top conferences with quicker turnaround times.  In most (all?) areas of computer science, the most competitive conferences are at least as highly regarded as the top journals.  It is also not unusual for longer versions of conference papers to later be submitted to journals.  As David Patterson (UC Berkeley), Larry Snyder (University of Washington), and Jeffrey Ullman wrote in Evaluating Computer Scientists and Engineers For Promotion and Tenure:    The evaluation of computer science and engineering faculty for    promotion and tenure has generally followed the dictate ""publish or    perish,"" where ""publish"" has had its standard academic meaning of    ""publish in archival journals"" [Academic Careers, 94]. Relying on    journal publications as the sole demonstration of scholarly    achievement, especially counting such publications to determine    whether they exceed a prescribed threshold, ignores significant    evidence of accomplishment in computer science and engineering. For    example, conference publication is preferred in the field, and    computational artifacts —software, chips, etc. —are a tangible means    of conveying ideas and insight. Obligating faculty to be evaluated by    this traditional standard handicaps their careers, and indirectly    harms the field. This document describes appropriate evidence of    academic achievement in computer science and engineering.    Your research advisor should be able to provide you advice more specific to your case.  I agree with amirg that having any publications when applying to a PhD program (especially based on undergraduate research) makes you exceptional.  Your advisor's recommendation also counts a lot, especially if he or she is well known.  ",1,Quality,quantity of research papers
"Graduate early with average GPA, or later with better GPA?","Your answer will depend partly on what you want to do in academia.  If you want to teach, but don't really want to emphasize research much, you might do fine to graduate now.  However, if your goal is to become a professor at a research intensive school, then you really should go to the strongest grad school you can get into.  (Based on your description, I strongly suspect that if you bust your butt for another year or two, in particular working to earn one or two strong letters of rec, you could get into a better grad school than you can currently.)    Yes, I know there are considerations about who you will work with, perhaps geography, potential two-body problems, etc.  So, why's it so important to go to the best school you can?  Again and again I see that in academia (as everywhere) networking is crucial.  Generalizing and stereotyping a bit: the best schools have the best researchers, who know the other best researchers, who have the biggest grants, which fund the nicest postdocs, etc. If you want to thrive as a researcher, you will do well to get into that network.  (To a large extent, it's a rich get richer system.)  As an undergrad or early grad student, one way you can get into that network is to work with a professor who is a central part of it, and is willing to weave you in.  And your chances of working with said professor typically go up with the reputation of the school.  Now a personal digression.  Through high school and undergrad I was in a hurry to get to the next level as soon as possible.  I skipped 7th grade, finished undergrad in 3 years, and started grad school at the age of 20.  I even turned down a year abroad in the Budapest Semester in Math, because I was worried I'd miss out if I waited too long to get to grad school.  The sad truth is that I wasn't ready.  Maybe you would be; I've never met you, so I can't say.  Eventually (after 8 years), I finished a PhD, and am fairly happy with where my career is headed.  However, I don't regret that time in grad school at all.  I learned a lot of useful stuff.  In fact, I think it's because I took my time in grad school that my career has gone as well as it has.  One interesting feature of academia is that you're typically judged by your productivity relative to the time since you earned your PhD (rather than your age).  As a result, I encourage you to take your time and learn as much as you can.  You'll never again have as much free time as you do now.  ",2,Graduate early with average GPA,later with better GPA
Which is more beneficial prior to PhD: research experience or a second Masters degree?,"The question is framed oddly.  A master's degree without research experience will probably kill your chances for PhD admission, at least into the top programs.  Here's a better framing: Is a second master's degree the best way to get more research experience?  Unfortunately, the answer depends on your personal situation.  If you're already doing active research with a strong possibility of formal publication, with well-known faculty collaborators who will write you strong letters of recommendation, then a second MS is probably not necessary.  If that doesn't describe your current research environment, a second MS might be the best way to find such an environment.  ",0,research experience,a second Masters degree
When writing a peer review is it better protocol to quote parts of the orginal work or paraphrase?,"It depends why you are quoting/paraphrasing.  Usually I structure my review in two parts. The first part summarizes the paper, the major contributions, and the high-level strengths and weaknesses of the submission. In this part I paraphrase. This shows the authors, and the editor, that I have read and understood the paper well enough to describe its ideas in my own words.  In the second part I get into the details, i.e. you forgot citation X, formula Y has an error, these sentences are confusing, etc. In this part I quote.

"For undergraduates, is publishing ""weak"" research better than not publishing?","There are very few circumstances under which I think it's a bad idea for undergraduates to write research papers. These primarily have to do with the quality of the journal: so long as it is a reputable, peer-reviewed journal, I wouldn't be too concerned with the ""strength"" of the work.  The reason is that publishing while an undergraduate—particularly as a primary author—demonstrates that you have already started to learn the basics of how to do research in your field. This means that you're less of an ""unknown"" quantity, and therefore less of a risk for a department reviewing your application. If you don't publish the research, then there's no tangible proof, and then you need to rely on your research supervisor to make that point in a letter of recommendation. (But then the question becomes: ""if she could have written a paper, why didn't she?"")  As for the exceptions above, so long as you don't publish in ""vanity"" journals (those which will publish basically anything, so long as people pay the appropriate publication ""fees""), you should be fine.

Differences between cooking a whole duck vs chicken or turkey?,"With chicken and turkey, the most important ""trick"" to cooking it is to make sure the dark meat gets done before the white meat dries out, and to make sure the skin crisps up somewhat.  Duck is all dark meat, and has a thick layer of fat that must be rendered out. There is not a lot of danger in drying out the breast meat like with a chicken.  Like Martha said, it's best to make a few shallow cuts in the skin over the breast (don't go all the way through to the meat) to help the fat render out. A simple (western) roasted bird would be cooked at 350°F for about 1 hour 45 min, with the oven turned up to 500°F for another 15 minutes to crisp up the skin. There is a LOT of fat rendered out, so it's best to roast in a sturdy roasting pan, on a rack (so it doesn't sit in the fat), and drain the fat about an hour into cooking (save the fat, though; it's delicious).  Personally, I think duck is easier to cook, but it's definitely different from roasting a chicken.  ",1,cooking a whole duck,chicken or turkey
What would be the difference between frying vs baking meatballs?,"No recipe alteration needed.  Fried meatballs will develop more of a crust, and thus more flavour through the Maillard reaction.

"When curing sausage, which is more important temperature or humidity?","You ned to get your hands on a computer fan (they are designed to run 24hrs a day).  I simply mounted one of these inside wall of my curing chamber (down low - as wet air drops), cut a hole in the wall of the fridge with a hole saw - which allows the fan to exhaust the moist air from within the curing chamber.  I also cut a similar sized hole at the top of the curing chamber on the opposite side which allows dry air to enter the chamber as the wet air is exhausted.  I have it rigged up to a cheap humidity controller I purchased off ebay, so when the controller detects high humidity (whatever you set it at), it exhausts the humid air.  ",2,temperature,humidity
"What's better for an algorithm complexity, O(log n) or amortized O(log n)?","$O(\log n)$ in the worst case implies $O(\lg n)$ amortized.  Basically, given two data structures supporting the same operator, one in $O(\lg n)$ time in the worst case and the other one in $O(\lg n)$ amortized time, the first one is considered to be superior asymptotically: being $O(\lg n)$ time in the worst case means that each call of the operator will be supported in this time, while having an amortized complexity of $O(\lg n)$ means that some (very few) operator calls can take $O(n)$ time. Usually, the concept of amortized analysis is used for data-structures which amortized complexity is better than their worst case complexity.  As an illustration, consider a data-structure for integers, storing each such integer $x$ as a string of bits (e.g. $x=8$ represented by $(1,0,0,0)$), and the operator $x.inc()$ which increments $x$ by $1$.     In the worst case (e.g. on $x=7$ represented by $(1,1,1)$), the operator $x.inc()$ corresponds to $\log(x)+1$ binary write (e.g. to write $(1,0,0,0)$ corresponding to $8$).   In the best case (e.g. on $x=8$), the operator $x.inc()$ corresponds to exactly one binary write (e.g. to change the last bit of $(1,0,0,0)$ to $1$, giving $(1,0,0,1)$).    In a sequence of increments of the same integer object (e.g. enumerating all integers from $0$), the ""best case"" described above happens half of the time, and the worst case one every $n$ increment (i.e. after $1,2,4,8,16,...$ increments). A case requiring $i$ bits write happens $1/2^i$ of the time. Summing all those costs gives an amortized cost of $\sum_i i/2^i \in O(1)$. Hence the operator $inc()$ has a worst case complexity of $O(\lg n)$ but an amortized complexity of $O(1)$.  The notion of amortized analysis is well explained on wikipedia. You might want to see the page on the Potential method for more details.  Hope it helps!  ",1,O(log n),amortized O(log n)

Is a 2 address machine more likely to follow a RISC or CISC design?,"The problem is that the terms RISC and CISC are marketing terms, not science or engineering terms.  The terms are supposedly acronyms for ""Reduced Instruction Set Computing"" and ""Complex Instruction Set Computing.""  Your assumption that 3 addresses is much more complicated than 0 addresses is logical, but there is no logic here, and typically 3-address instructions are associated with RISC and 2-address instructions are associated with CISC (and 1-address and 0-address instructions aren't very common any more, so aren't associated with either RISC or CISC).  The term RISC is generally associated with instruction sets that have the following characteristics:    Fixed width instructions.  Usually 32-bits or 16-bits.  This makes it easier for the instruction decoder to find the boundaries between instructions.  In CISC machines, by contrast, the different instructions can range in length from 8-bits to as much 64-bits.  This makes the job of the instruction decoder somewhat harder in CISC machines, but can result in programs consuming less memory.  Fewer operand addressing modes.  In a RISC machine typically each operator (add, sub, jmp, load) has only one available addressing mode for its operands (the a, b, c, d, and e in your picture.)  Typically for arithmetic type instructions (add, sub, xor, ...) the only available addressing mode is register direct.  The source operands are found in registers, and the result of the computation can only be placed in a register. Load and store type instructions typically have one operand that is register direct and the other operand is register indirect plus offset.  Jump and branch type instructions will typically have a target operand that is pc relative.   There will typically also be a few jump and branch type instructions with a register indirect target, and sometimes a jump instruction with an absolute target operand.  The smaller number of operand addressing modes is typically the only way in which ""RISC"" instruction sets are actually reduced (compared to ""CISC"" instruction sets).  The reasoning, again, has to do with trying to keep the instruction decoder as simple as possible in RISC machines.  The simple operand addressing modes are easier to implement in a simple pipeline, and so the decoder in modern CISC machines often has to do extra work to crack instructions with complex operand modes into sequences of micro-operations that are more like RISC instructions.  There is a tendency for RISC architectures to have more register names available.  Many RISC architectures have 32 registers, while many CISC architectures have only 8 or 16.  This again has to do with making it somewhat simpler to exploit instruction-level parallelism with a simple pipeline.  Having more available register names makes it possible for the compiler to use different register names for unrelated computations, without requiring the hardware to do register renaming.  RISC architectures tend to have ""3-address"" instructions, while CISC architectures tend to have mostly ""2-address"" instructions.  The notion of ""3-address"" vs. ""2-address"" is also somewhat fuzzy (and somewhat mis-named).  Every add instruction has 3 operands, 2 source operands and 1 destination operand.  The real distinction is whether those operands are explicit or implicit.  In a so-called ""3-address"" instruction you make all 3 operands explicit.  In a so-called ""2-address"" instruction you make the destination operand explicit and one of the source operands explicit.  The third source operand is implicit: it is always the same address as the destination operand.  In a so-called ""1-address"" instruction only one of the source operands is explicit.  The other source operand is implicitly either an accumulator register or the top of the stack, as is the destination operand.  Finally in a ""0-address"" instruction all the operands are implicit (usually the two source operands are the top two values on the stack and the destination goes back on the top of the stack.)    To sum up: these are all marketing terms, and don't really mean much.  The important concepts have to do with the relationship between different instruction-set design choices and how those choices make it easier or harder to implement hardware pipelines.

"Decision problems vs ""real"" problems that aren't yes-or-no","As you said, there is no decision to make, so new complexity classes and new types of reductions are needed to arrive at a suitable definition of NP-hardness for optimization-problems.  One way of doing this is to have two new classes NPO and PO that contain optimizations problems and they mimic of course the classes NP and P for decision problems. New reductions are needed as well. Then we can recreate a version of NP-hardness for optimization problems along the lines that was successful for decision problems. But first we have to agree what an optimization-problem is.  Definition: Let $O=(X,L,f,opt)$ be an optimization-problem. $X$ is the set of inputs or instances suitable encoded as strings. $L$ is a function that maps each instance $x\in X$ onto a set of strings, the feasible solutions of instance $x$. It is a set because there are many solutions to an optimization-problem. Thus we haven an objective function $f$ that tells us for every pair $(x, y)$ $y\in L(x)$ of instance and solution its cost or value. $opt$ tells us whether we are maximizing or minimizing.  This allows us to define what an optimal solution is: Let $y_{opt}\in L(x)$ be the optimal solution of an instance $x\in X$ of an optimization-problem $O=(X,L,f,opt)$ with $$f(x,y_{opt})=opt\{f(x,y')\mid y'\in L(x)\}.$$ The optimal solution is often denoted by $y^*$.  Now we can define the class NPO: Let $NPO$ be the set of all optimization-problems $O=(X,L,f,opt)$ with:    $X\in P$  There is a polynomial $p$ with $|y|\le p(|x|)$ for all instances $x\in X$ and all feasible solutions $y\in L(x)$. Furthermore there is an deterministic algorithm that decides in polynomial time whether $y\in L(x)$.  $f$ can be evaluated in polynomial time.    The intuition behind it is:    We can verify efficiently if $x$ is actually a valid instance of our optimization problem.  The size of the feasible solutions is bounded polynomially in the size of the inputs, And we can verify efficiently if $y\in L(x)$ is a fesible solution of the instance $x$.  The value of a solution $y\in L(x)$ can be determined efficiently.    This mirrors how $NP$ is defined, now for PO: Let $PO$ be the set of all problems from $NPO$ that can be solved by an deterministic algorithm in polynomial time.  Now we are able to define what we want to call an approximation-algorithm: An approximation-algorithm of an optimization-problem $O=(X,L,f,opt)$ is an algorithm that computes a feasible solution $y\in L(x)$ for an instance $x\in X$.  Note: That we don’t ask for an optimal solution we only what to have a feasible one.  Now we have two types of errors: The absolute error of a feasible solution $y\in L(x)$ of an instance $x\in X$ of the optimization-problem $O=(X,L,f,opt)$ is $|f(x,y)-f(x,y^*)|$.  We call the absolute error of an approximation-algorithm $A$ for the optimization-problem $O$ bounded by $k$ if the algorithm $A$ computes for every instance $x\in X$ a feasible solution with an absolute error bounded by $k$.  Example: According to the Theorem of Vizing the chromatic index of a graph (the number of colours in the edge coloring with the fewest number of colors used) is either $\Delta$ or $\Delta+1$, where $\Delta$ is the maximal node degree. From the proof of the theorem an approximation-algorithm can be devised that computes an edge coloring with $\Delta+1$ colours. Accordingly we have an approximation-algorithm for the $\mathsf{Minimum-EdgeColoring}$-Problem where the absolute error is bounded by $1$.  This example is an exception, small absolute errors are rare, thus we define the relative error $\epsilon_A(x)$ of the approximation-algorithm $A$ on instance $x$ of the optimization-problem $O=(X,L,f,opt)$ with $f(x,y)>0$ for all $x\in X$ and $y\in L(x)$ to be  $$\epsilon_A(x):=\begin{cases}0&f(x,A(x))=f(x,y^*)\\\frac{|f(x,A(x))-f(x,y^*)|}{\max\{f(x,A(x)),f(x,y^*)\}}&f(x,A(x))\ne f(x,y^*)\end{cases}$$  where $A(x)=y\in L(x)$ is the feasible solution computed by the approximation-algorithm $A$.  We can now define approximation-algorithm $A$ for the optimization-problem $O=(X,L,f,opt)$ to be a $\delta$-approximation-algorithm for $O$ if the relative error $\epsilon_A(x)$ is bounded by $\delta\ge 0$ for every instance $x\in X$, thus  $$\epsilon_A(x)\le \delta\qquad \forall x\in X.$$  The choice of $\max\{f(x,A(x)),f(x,y^*)\}$ in the denominator of the definition of the relative error was selected to make the definition symmetric for maximizing and minimizing. The value of the relative error $\epsilon_A(x)\in[0,1]$. In case of a maximizing problem the value of the solution is never less than $(1-\epsilon_A(x))\cdot f(x,y^*)$ and never larger than $1/(1-\epsilon_A(x))\cdot f(x,y^*)$ for a minimizing problem.  Now we can call an optimization-problem $\delta$-approximable if there is a $\delta$-approximation-algorithm $A$ for $O$ that runs in polynomial time.  We do not want to look at the error for every instance $x$, we look only at the worst-case. Thus we define $\epsilon_A(n)$, the maximal relativ error of the approximation-algorithm $A$ for the optimization-problem $O$ to be  $$\epsilon_A(n)=\sup\{\epsilon_A(x)\mid |x|\le n\}.$$  Where $|x|$ should be the size of the instance.  Example: A maximal matching in a graph can be transformed in to a minimal node cover $C$ by adding all incident nodes from the matching to the vertex cover. Thus $1/2\cdot |C|$ edges are covered. As each vertex cover including the optimal one must have one of the nodes of each covered edge, otherwise it could be improved, we have $1/2\cdot |C|\cdot f(x,y^*)$. It follows that $$\frac{|C|-f(x,y^*)}{|C|}\le\frac{1}{2}$$  Thus the greedy algorithm for a maximal matching is a $1/2$-approximatio-algorithm for $\mathsf{Minimal-VertexCover}$. Hence $\mathsf{Minimal-VertexCover}$ is $1/2$-approximable.  Unfortunately the relative error is not always the best notion of quality for an approximation as the following example demonstrates:  Example: A simple greedy-algorithm can approximate $\mathsf{Minimum-SetCover}$. An analysis shows that $$\frac{|C|}{|C^*|}\le H_n\le 1+\ln(n)$$ and thus $\mathsf{Minimum-SetCover}$ would be $\frac{\ln(n)}{1+\ln(n)}$-approximable.  If the relative error is close to $1$ the following definition is advantageous.  Let $O=(X,L,f,opt)$ be an optimization-problem with $f(x, y)>0$ for all $x\in X$ and $y\in L(x)$ and $A$ an approximation-algorithm for $O$. The approximation-ratio $r_A(x)$ of feasible solution $A(x)=y\in L(x)$ of the instance $x\in X$ is  $$r_A(x)=\begin{cases}1&f(x,A(x))=f(x,y^*)\\\max\left\{  \frac{f(x,A(x))}{f(x, y^*)},\frac{f(x, y^*)}{f(x, A(x))}\right\}&f(x,A(x))\ne f(x,y^*)\end{cases}$$  As before we call an approximation-algorithm $A$ an $r$-approximation-algorithm for the optimization-problem $O$ if the approximation-ratio $r_A(x)$ is bounded by $r\ge1$ for every input $x\in X$.  $$r_A(x)\le r$$  And yet again if we have an $r$-approximation-algorithm $A$ for the optimization-problem $O$ then $O$ is called $r$-approximable. Again we only care about to the worst-case and define the maximal approximation-ratio $r_A(n)$ to be  $$r_A(n)=\sup\{r_A(x)\mid |x|\le n\}.$$  Accordingly the approximation-ratio is larger than $1$ for suboptimal solutions. Thus better solutions have smaller ratios. For $\mathsf{Minimum-SetCover}$ we can now write that it is $(1+\ln(n))$-approximable. And in case of $\mathsf{Minimum-VertexCover}$ we know from the previous example that it is $2$-approximable. Between relative error and approximation-ratio we have simple relations:  $$r_A(x)=\frac{1}{1-\epsilon_A(x)}\qquad \epsilon_A(x)=1-\frac{1}{r_A(x)}.$$  For small deviations from the optimum $\epsilon<1/2$ and $r<2$ the relative error is advantageous over the approximation-ratio, that shows its strengths for large deviations $\epsilon\ge 1/2$ and $r\ge 2$.  The two versions of $\alpha$-approximable don’t overlap as one version has always $\alpha\le 1$ and the other $\alpha\ge 1$. The case $\alpha=1$ is not problematic as this is only reached by algorithms that produce an exact solution and consequentially need not be treated as approximation-algorithms.  Another class appears often APX. It is define as the set of all optimization-problems $O$ from $NPO$ that haven an $r$-approximation-algorithm with $r\ge1$ that runs in polynomial time.  We are almost through. We would like to copy the successful ideas of reductions and completness from complexity theory. The observation is that many NP-hard decision variants of optimization-problems are reducible to each other while their optimization variants have different properties regarding their approximability. This is due to the polynomialtime-Karp-reduction used in NP-completness reductions, which does not preserve the objective function. And even if the objective functions is preserved the polynomialtime-Karp-reduction may change the quality of the solution.  What we need is a stronger version of the reduction, which not only maps instances from optimization-problem $O_1$ to instances of $O_2$, but also good solutions from $O_2$ back to good solutions from $O_1$.  Hence we define the approximation-preserving-reduction for two optimization-problems $O_1=(X_1,L_1,f_1,opt_1)$ and $O_2=(X_2,L_2,f_2,opt_2)$ from $NPO$. We call $O_1$ $AP$-reducible to $O_2$, written as $O_1\le_{AP} O_2$, if there are two functions $g$ and $h$ and a constant $c$ with:    $g(x_1, r)\in X_2$ for all $x_1\in X_1$ and rational $r>1$  $L_2(g(x, r_1))\ne\emptyset$ if $L_1(x_1)\ne\emptyset$ for all $x_1\in X_1$ and rational $r>1$  $h(x_1, y_2, r)\in L_1(x_1)$ for all $x_1\in X_1$ and rational $r>1$ and for all $y_2\in L_2(g(x_1,r))$  For fixed $r$ both functions $g$ and $h$ can be computed by two algorithms in polynomial time in the length of their inputs.  We have $$f_2(g(x_1,r),y_2)\le r \Rightarrow f_1(x_1,h(x_1,y_2,r))\le 1+c\cdot(r-1) $$ for all $x_1\in X_1$ and rational $r>1$ and for all $y_2\in L_2(g(x_1,r))$    In this definition $g$ and $h$ depend on the quality of the solution $r$. Thus for different qualities the functions can differ. This generality is not always needed and we just work with $g(x_1)$ and $h(x_1, y_2)$.  Now that we have a notion of a reduction for optimization-problems we finally can transfer many things we know from complexity theory. For example if we know that $O_2\in APX$ and we show that $O_1\le_{AP} O_2$ it follows that $O_1\in APX$ too.  Finally we can define what we mean by $\mathcal{C}$-hard and $\mathcal{C}$-complete for optimization-problems:  Let $O$ be an optimization-problem from $NPO$ and $\mathcal{C}$ a class of optimization-problems from $NPO$ then $O$ is called $\mathcal{C}$-hard with respect to $\le_{AP}$ if for all $O'\in\mathcal{C}$ $O'\le_{AP} O$ holds.  Thus once more we have a notion of a hardest problem in the class. Not surprising a $\mathcal{C}$-hard problem is called $\mathcal{C}$-complete with respect to $\le_{AP}$ if it is an element of $\mathcal{C}$.  Thus we can now talk about $NPO$-completness and $APX$-completness etc. And of course we are now asked to exhibit a first $NPO$-complete problem that takes over the role of $\mathsf{SAT}$. It comes almost naturally, that $\mathsf{Weighted-Satisfiability}$ can be shown to be $NPO$-complete. With the help of the PCP-Theorem one can even show that $\mathsf{Maximum-3SAT}$ is $APX$-complete.  ",0,Decision problems,"""real"" problems that aren't yes-or-no"
Which is faster operations on register operands or immediate operands?,"It depends.  Like AProgrammer said, it depends on the processor.  We are in an age where there are many limiting factors based on physics in CPU construction. This means that distance traveled for an instruction and heat generated by a gate cause latency. In theory, this means that for a pipeline where the bottleneck is the decoding stage, this matters. With immediate operands, you would not need to travel to the register to grab the values, which is additional clock cycles and distance traveled. This would decrease latency, and thus increase speed.  However, in real world applications, this is very likely NOT the bottleneck, and so there will be little to no increase (if mandatory register access stages exist) in speed.

When would best first search be worse than breadth first search?,"Best first search is different from BFS and DFS by that that it uses problem specific information to chose which node of the search tree to expand next. Best first search is informed search and DFS and BFS are uninformed searches.  In order to use informed search algorithm you need to represent the knowledge of the problem as heuristic function.  Best first search is sometimes another name for Greedy Best First Search, but it may also mean class of search algorithms, that chose to expand the most promising node based on an evaluation function(not necessary the same as the heuristics) such as Greedy Best First Search, A* and others.    If you meant Greedy Best First Search:    it is complete (finds a solution in finite graphs) like BFS  it is not optimal(to find the least cost solution) as DFS, but BFS is optimal when the cost of each arc is the same  in the worst case its time and space complexity is O($b^n$), where b is the branching factor and n is the maximal depth. For BFS time and space complexity is O($b^m$), where m is the depth of the shallowest goal.  Greedy best-first search is in most cases better than BFS- it depends on the heuristic function and the structure of the problem. If the heuristic function is not good enough it can mislead the algorithm to expand nodes that look promising, but are far from the goal. Here is one simple example    Let all arcs have the same cost, S - start node, G - goal node and h-heuristic function  Here Greedy best-first search will expand : S,B,C,D,G   And BFS will only expand : S,A,B,G    ",2,best first search,breadth first search
Is a potted grapevine better put under or outside a roof?,"I don't think it'll make much difference - you live in an area where there's good rainfall, which is good for plants in the ground, but plants in containers still need watering, regardless. Marginally, a plant in a pot outside the roof will remain damper in winter than one under the roof, but during the growing season, you will need to water regularly whether the pots are in or outside. If they are under the roof, you will need to check them during winter to see whether they need water or not.  ",0,under,outside a roof
Pros and Cons of wood vs stone mulch,"I'm not a fan of stone/gravel mulch. I use it in one spot for a specific reason but it's hard to keep it looking clean. Weeds will still grow in it or past it. Either because the landscape fabric underneath deteriorates or because organic material falls onto the gravel and collects in the spaces between the gravel and allows seeds to germinate.  If you want to clean it well you basically have to set up a sifting operation like an 1850's prospector. Since it doesn't decompose topping it off with fresh gravel just creates a deeper mulch bed. As the landscape fabric wears out the gravel can sink into the soil so when that happens I guess you can top off then.  It doesn't really suppress weeds as well as organic mulches. It's mostly the landscape fabric that does that. If you ever want to change it it's a giant PITA.  The microclimate around the gravel bed will be warmer and retain heat longer which may cause issues with some plants or require more frequent watering.  I'm not a big fan of generic wood mulch either. For wood mulch I prefer cedar mulch because that's one of the better choices available around me. The oils in it can repel insects such as termites, cedar mulch is less likely to harbor artillery fungus (as does cypress and pine park mulch), it lasts a long time, I don't have to worry as much about scrap pressure treated wood or toxic paint winding up in the mulch and I like the smell when I put it down.  A 1/2 cubic foot bag of gravel costs about $4. For that same $4 I can get a high quality 3 cubic foot bag of cedar mulch. It's lighter, easier to work with, suppresses weeds when put on thick enough, breaks down to add nutrients to the soil. Insulates the soil and retains moisture and I like the way it looks.   You put on about 3"" the first year, then add about 1"" every year, or even every other year depending on your climate. After a month or so the color fades to grey. You can get died mulches but the color only lasts about a season and will need to be topped off to look new or you can get some mulch dyes to refresh the color.  Haven't had an issue with either washing away but the cedar mulch seems to hold better on slopes.  Aesthetics... when done properly stone mulch can have a very dramatic and high end look. When it starts to look like crap then it looks like crap. Organic mulches are easy to refresh and have looking like new by only topping off a bit every year.  Costs for a 100 square foot bed with 3"" of mulch:  Stone: Initial cost 50 bags * $4 = $200 though 50 bags is a lot to transport bulk pricing would be cheaper.  Cedar: Initial cost 9 bags * $4 = $36  Top off with 3 bags every year = $12 a year.  It would take over 12 years for the cedar mulch to cost as much as the stone. Are you sure you're not going to want to rearrange your landscape, want to change color scheme in mulch or will still like the same look for such a long period of time?  Spreading around some extra mulch on top of beds to me feels a lot easier than trying to clean gravel beds.  ",1,wood,stone mulch
Organic or Traditional lawn fertilizer: which is safer for areas with young children?,"This is a difficult one if you have children. First, let's deal with the two fertilizers you've mentioned - the first one, non organic, has a much higher Nitrogen level, as you've noticed, nearly 3 times the level of the organic one, and is much more suitable for use in Fall. Because its an autumn formulation, it will take longer to break down than the organic one you have, which does not seem to be specifically for autumn use. It also means you need less of it so its usually spread more thinly, and its the one I would choose in these circumstances.  The usual advice where children will be playing on grass after treatment is to use a liquid which, once its dry, is no trouble to either pets or children, and this is particularly useful in summer. However, because its Fall, you do actually need a product in granular or dry formulation because the idea is it breaks down gradually, over a much longer period of time than a liquid would do, which is more or less instant. Regarding the difference between them, in theory, either product could burn skin if the person is in prolonged contact and is particularly sensitive, but I imagine your children won't be lying for hours on the grass with bare skin.   Although the idea of an organic product seems better, in practice, bonemeal can produce dust, attracts various animals who think its something interesting to eat, and isn't any safer from a skin point of view when compared with the non organic product. So, on balance, I'd recommend the non organic version, carefully spread at exactly the right rate and no more, following the instructions to the letter. You should exclude children and pets whilst the treatment is carried out, and it would be better to keep them off the area until its been well watered in over a couple of days or so. I know the instructions say no need to water in, but if your sense of smell is good, after such a treatment is spread, the first couple of times it gets wet you can actually smell the treatment in the air, so I'd water it in regardless.  I do have one caveat though - I would check with Scott's first before using anything, to make sure that any product you choose is suitable for a lawn which has only been down a couple of months. If its like Scotts products here in the UK, there should be a contact phone number on the packaging for queries/customer service. It would also be interesting to find out what product, and its NPK ratio, the installer would use himself...  ",2,Organic,Traditional lawn fertilizer
Do rye or oats make a better winter cover for a poor soil vegetable garden?,"I think the answer depends on more factors than what you've provided in the question -- especially your specific goals, but I can lay out the considerations I would make in choosing between the two.  According to a UVM factsheet, rye can add 5 tons of organic matter per acre. I like rye because the seed is cheap, it germinates quickly and reliably, you can start it late, it catches reliably, it always survives the winter, and it goes like gangbusters when the snow melts in spring. The only real downsides I can think of are (a) it is so vigorous it can be challenging to till under in the spring, and (b) it is allelopathic so you can't sow seeds for a couple of weeks after tilling.  I have less experience with oats -- and none as a winter cover crop, only spring seeded. According to a SARE document, oats can add 1-2 tons per acre with fall seeding. Locally for me, oat seed is less available than rye. Also for me, oats will reliably winter kill, which means it would need to be started earlier in the fall -- but it also would be easier to incorporate in spring. Oats also have allelopathic properties; I think winterkilled oats won't cause problems in the spring. Because of the allelopathy, you should wait 3 weeks (according to SARE) before planting after tilling the oats under.  Either cover crop makes a good nitrogen trap -- ""soaking up"" excess nitrogen left in the soil following the previous main crop and storing it for the following season. They both do a good job of smothering weeds.  The SARE document on oats linked above mentions in ""Comparative Notes"" at the bottom:    [Compared to Oats,] Rye grows more in fall and early spring, absorbs more N and matures faster, but is harder to establish, to kill and to till than oats.     So I guess if you've got a good rototiller and are willing to work at tilling it under in the spring, rye would be my recommendation.  ",1,rye,oats
Are citrus trees better grown using containers or in the ground?,"I've seen many citrus trees in pots.  In fact where I live that is all I see since they'd have to come inside during the winter.  I'd think that the trees would do fine in a pot.  If you get a decent size pot they will grow to fill that pot.    I'm not sure what you mean by stunted by being in a pot.  The tree size will be limited because of the pot, but if removed from the pot it should grow like normal.  So it will not be permanently affected.   ",1,containers,in the ground

Ubuntu vs. Mac OS,"It depends on whether or not you'll use the advantages of owning a mac.  Being a Win->Linux->Mac->Linux user, I've established the following:  Buy a mac if:    You have a mac store in your area. Problems that arise can be solved right at the local store, and are covered for free for a year through AppleCare.  Otherwise, its the same as having a support plan from any other big name company.  You will actually get use out of proprietary software (iLife, etc).  I found that the only proprietary app I used was Garage Band, and that was for fun/free time, and there are definitely MUCH better alternatives.  You're OK conforming to forced upon and immutable design decisions. Keep reading 'different style laptop' and 'ui customization' below.    Buy a PC if:    Using Linux, you want to do anything.  As some have mentioned, ""linux is good for computer savvy people/developers.""  This is a misconception, as I have seen both smart and dumb users from age 7 to age 82 using Ubuntu with no trouble.  On the other end, I've seen advanced users with fully custom systems that do everything they want, and usually for no financial cost(time cost though).  You don't NEED apple software.  There are as good or better alternatives to any apple software.  You want more choices.  By buying a PC:  You have many choices for different manufacturers and hardware.  You can spend as much as you want to spend on a laptop, and don't have to pay a proprietary-software-tax to get it. (windows-preinstalled will have a slight added cost)  You can choose a different style laptop. I found my white polycarbonate/plastic macbook to be very uncomfortable, the speakers sucked, loud fan @ high CPU, and the plastic was cheap/got dirty.  Basically, be ready to get angry at design-over-functionality choices that Apple makes. At least the MBP doesn't have speakers right in the fan bay ><)  UI Customization.  Using Linux, you can literally make your user interface how you want it.  Things like OpenBox and more allow you to fine tune your experience.  Even windows has applications that let you modify your UI (to a degree).  As of the last time I used OSX, you basically have to suck up the way Apple decides to design your UI.  Software!. Running an ubuntu system, you can install software over the interwebs with ease using Package Managers. (Fink for Mac will do this too, not sure how well it works with everything though).  You can dual boot w/Linux or Windows, and even create a hackintosh.  I've seen OSX running well on a netbook. Nuff said.      In sum, and as some others have mentioned, buy a Mac if you NEED a mac(and, of course, if you really like the feel of the laptops/ui/etc).

What is the difference between Sleep and Hibernate?,"Sleep is commonly known as Standby in Windows systems or S3 in ACPI. In Sleep mode, the power supply to non-essential and non-critical components is withheld, and most system operations are shutdown and stopped. All data in physical memory (RAM) is still kept in internal memory, and the whole system is placed in a standby mode, which can be woken up and used almost immediately.  In Sleep mode, the power load reduces considerably, saving energy. However, the power to the machine must not be cut off completely. If power is lost, the system state will also be lost and the computer will behave as though just booted from a powered-off state.  Hibernate, or S4 in ACPI, meanwhile will save the data in physical memory to the hard disk drive first, and then power off the computer.   In Hibernate mode, a file named hiberfil.sys, which has the same file size as the amount of system memory, will be created on the local disk. When the user restarts the machine, it will boot up and load back the system state at the point of the last hibernation.  The advantage of Hibernation mode is that no power is wasted. In Hibernation, no electricity is consumed by the system so a computer can be kept in this state indefinitely.  Also, restoring from Hibernate is generally faster than a computer reboot. It is also different from a reboot in the sense that users can return to the exact state of the last hibernation with all running programs and open documents intact, instead of booting to an empty desktop.  The disadvantage of Hibernation is that after a period of time, there may be fragmentation of the hiberation file. Users may need to defragment the volume that stores the hibernation file frequently.  Answer adapted from here  ",2,Sleep,Hibernate

Should I change most of my money in my home country or in the destination country? baht to canadian dollars....change in thailand or canada,"This varies very much depending on your country of origin and your destination.  Best exchange rate mean lowest spread, but keep in mind, that some banks apart of the spread, also charge extra commissions.   Keeping that in mind, there are some general tendencies. Exchange rates, from best, to worst:    electronic transactions (i.e. transactions made directly with the credit card). These usually have the lowest spread (or none at all for major currencies) and typically using major credit cards there is no extra commission. This is the preferred option when you're traveling in developed countries.   cash withdrawal (usually ATM, note however, that on rare occasions when paying with card, it'll be actually charged as cash withdrawal). This usually has decent spread, some banks charge commissions, some don't. Your Mileage May Vary. Check availability of ATMs accepting your cards beforehand. In some exotic countries you'll only get them at main airport. (btw. some banks/ATM operators charge fixed or minimum fee per transaction, so it's better to make one bigger withdrawal, than a number of smaller ones).   money exchange at your bank, i.e. withdrawing money from your account in other currency. Problem with that is, that it's impractical to carry around large quantities of cash when you're traveling.   local money exchange, least favorable, but in really exotic countries that might be your only option.

"If I visit Los Angeles, am I better off renting a car or not?","Rent the car!  Los Angeles is built for cars. It has some of the worst public transportation imaginable, ever since General Motors conspired to eliminate the city's trolley system. Yes, there are buses and taxis, but you will find that buses take forever (and get stuck in the same traffic) and taxis are hard to find and expensive.  Only 11% of Los Angeles residents get to work by public transportation (compared to, say, New York with 54%).   There are plenty of cities where public transportation is an option (New York, Chicago, San Francisco) but LA is not one of them.  UPDATE 2015 Since I wrote this answer, the rise of ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft has, for the first time, made it more reasonable to get around in Los Angeles without your own car. You may want to compare the cost of ride-sharing services vs. renting a car (and paying for parking) depending on how much you want get around. If you are going to a lot of different parts of the city, a rental car is likely to be cheaper, but if you're staying mostly in one neighborhood and not moving around a lot, you may find ride-sharing services to be more affordable.

Is it cheaper to buy a tour to the Galápagos Islands at home or when in Ecuador?,"First off, it's never going to be 'cheap', unfortunately.  There are a few reasons for this.  (*these prices correct as of November 2010)  The Base  If you fly, there's no way around the fixed fare of USD$420 to fly return from Quito or Guayaquil.  Then there's the $100 National Park entrance fee.  And another $10 for taxes.  So we'll ignore all that and just call that the 'base', and focus on the rest being cheaper...  A lot seem to focus on the cruise you'll ""need"" to do.  That's not always the case.  From this site:    The airport beside Santa Cruz is on a small nearby island in the north    side called Baltera, and from here you must get a 50 cent ferry    across, then a $3 bus down south to the town. Once in town, it's very    easy to set yourself up with a $20 private hotel room with A/C and TV,    and even Wifi! Even out here in the middle of the Pacific ocean you    remain connected to your Facebook Wall posts! (or GlobeNotes    obviously!)  The volcanic island of Isabella is about 2 hours by boat from Santa    Cruz, and boats leave daily for only $25-30. Bear in mind that boats    only leave Santa Cruz at 2pm, and then leave Isabella only at 6am, so    an overnight is required.  Many people have told me that, with these two islands (Isabella alone    being 52% of the total Galapagos landmass) you can actually see MOST    of the wildlife that you see on the far off islands that require    cruises, the main exception being red-footed boobies and a few other    bird species which are only found on the remote islands.    Giant-Tortoise, Sea lions, Penguins, and TONS of Iguana. You name it..    you can see them all within about 15 min boat ride from the coast of    either Isabella or Santa Cruz. Score!    It's worth noting that according to Wikitravel:    If you are planning to visit the Galapagos Islands, Guayaquil is the    cheapest place to take a flight from. There are three air carriers    that will take you across the Galapagos Islands as well as the    Ecuadorean mainland, LAN-ECUADOR 3, Aerogal 4 and TAME [5] have    non stop daily flights, departing from Guayaquil is cheaper than    leaving from Quito(Is closer and most of the Quito flights do make an    stop at Guayaquil's airport for Refueling and picking up passengers.  International departure airport tax was just recently increased in    Guayaquil and is exactly $29.75 (January 2010). About 15$ cheaper than    Quito airport.    Now, once you're in Quito or Guayaquil, there are two sides to consider with tours.  One - the travel agents will often claim the  best tours are gone months in advance.  Certainly some will be, but I've NEVER hard of a person disappointed with their tour, no matter when they booked it.  However, I have heard of some FANTASTIC deals bought on the ground in Quito.  When staying at the Secret Garden Hostel in Quito, the Carpedm tour company downstairs was very closely linked with the hostel, offering free city tours and salsa lessons and the like.  In addition, they were able to advise people about Galapagos options.  I heard of people getting final berths on 5-star boats for the equivalent of paying 2 days for 7, others getting discounted meals, and they were all booked in Quito or Guayaquil.  So in conclusion, it's hard to say for certain whether things are cheaper on the ground, but from anecdotal opinions, my experience, and the very reason tour companies exist in these cities, is that it is possible to beat prices when on the ground.  And of course, this will flex with seasonal trends - more likely to get bargains in low season.    ",2,at home,when in Ecuador
Should I book Thailand Rail tickets online (pre-trip) or at the station when I arrive?,"I have not used that web site, but always bought the tickets a day in advance at the station or even just when getting on the train in Thailand. For sleepers I would recommend to buy in advance, just to be sure.  Whether you should buy before your trip really depends on how sure you are about the dates. What if you really like a place and want to stay a few extra days. Booking them while you are there gives you much more flexibility.   Rather than going to the train station you can still book online while you are in Thailand, there is internet access everywhere.  ",0,online (pre-trip),at the station when I arrive
Last minute flight bookings - better to book online or at the airport?,I might contribute some inside knowledge since I am working for a company which contributed the software for a major cheap-flight company.   Generally the prices are determined by offer and the demand BUT there is another major variable (in fact several) in the game for short-booking. Statistics show that most (80%) last-minute bookers are in an important need for the short booking and therefore willing to pay more. So the function which generates the price for short-bookings is not a complete function of offer and demand any more like it was years ago.  If you want to know what's the deal do the following: Go to your online bookers homepage. Search for a flight which is taking off today and try to book that ticket. With this you firstly know how short you can book online and secondly if the prices are acceptable for you.   Your question is also highly location dependant. In the country I live (Switzerland) I get the cheapest flights through a friend who works at the airport and calls me when a certain flight is available. I can only recommend trying both the online and physical approach.  ,0,online,at the airport
Should I buy an around the world ticket from Australia or a nearby country?,"Depends(tm).  For Star Alliance RTW tickets, which are probably the single most popular choice (but not necessarily the cheapest), prices do vary considerably by country, although this is largely due to currency fluctuations and you need to do a bit of legwork to figure out how much you can actually save.  Here's a thread discussing the prices, including a handy spreadsheet showing the prices equalized into US dollars as of Jan 2011:  [REF]    So a year ago, a YRWSPCL (the cheapest option) would have cost you US$3282 in Australia, but US$2646 from Malawi.  Problem is, it'll cost you a lot more than $600 to get to Malawi and back, and as far as I can see none of the countries you can cheaply reach from Oz have much of an edge: NZ is only marginally cheaper at US$3059 and eg. Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand are all more expensive.

What are the advantages and disadvantages to using a griddle instead of a cast-iron skillet?,"Yes, you don't have the edge of a pan in the way when going to flip things, but it also means that you don't have a mass of metal there to add as a heat sink, which can help dramatically when pre-heating your pans, as they'll be evenly heated across their bottom more quickly (at least, compared to something of the same material, such as a cast iron skillet)  More importantly, in my opinion, is that without the sides, you don't hold in moist air, so when cooking things like hash browns, you can get a better crust on 'em without steaming them.

"What is the lesser evil, degassing too early or too late?","In my experience (and I'm only an amateur baker), you could leave this until you get back and knock it back then.  If you leave it really long (e.g. 24 hours), you might find it just doesn't have enough life left in it to rise again properly after, but an extra hour or so will probably improve it - I've always found that recipes err on the side of speed.    For a 2 hour prove time, I'd keep it slightly cool but not fridge-cool.  Since you're using a very wet dough, you will find it gets a little stickier the longer you leave it, so might need slightly more flour when shaping.  Having said that, I've recently been experimenting with really long rise times (12-24 hours, for ciabatta) - I just haven't found a happy medium yet that suits me.   ",2,degassing too early,too late
What is the difference between Milk Chocolate and Dark Chocolate?,"Short answer:  yes, milk chocolate differs from chocolate by the milk its manufacture.  Real chocolate (as opposed to many other confections) is made from chocolate liquer, which despite the name, is not alchoholic, or even liquid at room temperature.  The fruit of the theobroma cacao tree contains seeds, known as beans.  The harvested fruits are allowed to ferment, bringing many flavor and chemical changes to the beans, as well as removing the pulpy fruit.   The beans are then husked for the seeds inside, the nibs.  The nibs are the first true chocolate product, although they are not sweet.  The nibs are roasted, and then ground.  This is chocolate liquer, a solid colloid of cocoa fat and solid particles.  It would be solid at room temperature, but the grinding process melts it.  The cocoa liquer can be pressed to separate out the cocoa butter (as for use in the cosmetics industry), leaving cocoa powder, but that is not the point of your question.  Instead, to manufacture chocolate, the liquer is conched, a mechanical process that makes the suspended particles much smaller, part of what gives chocolate its smooth mouthfeel.   Various products can be made from chocolate liquer, or cocoa butter, including:    baking chocolate - essentially, just chocolate liquer, hardened and tempereded.  May or may not be fully conched, so may not be as smooth as chocolate intended for eating.  chocolate or dark chocolate - Chocolate liquer, possibly extra cocoa butter, and sugar.  Minor optional ingredients often included are vanilla or other flavorings, and lecithen, an emulsifier.  milk chocolate - Same as dark chocolate, with the addition of condensed milk or milk solids, depending on whether it is made via the Swiss method or the Hershey method  white chocolate - cocoa butter, plus sugar and other flavorings  chocolate chips - Another form of chocolate in a particular shape.  Many manufacturers don't make these from true chocolate, but rather substitute another fat which doesn't melt as easily as cocoa butter, for economy, and so the chips hold their shape in the oven  chocolate bunny - Chocolate molded into the shape of a bunny, then tempered and cooled  German's chocolate - A brand name of quite sweet dark chocolate    Chocolate labels which list ""cocoa percentage"" are saying what proportion of the chocolate is cocoa liquer or additional cocoa butter or cocoa solids--that is, stuff from nibs, as opposed to sugar or other flavorings.  The cocoa percentage for milk chocolate tends to be much lower than that of dark chocolates, although not every milk chocolate has a lower percentage than every dark chocolate.  See this question for information on tempering chocolate, which gives its snappy mouthfeel.   Edit:  On dairy products in dark chocolate:  I was very surprised at Lemontwist's comment, so I did some googling and found this article at Go Dairy Free:    A good quality dark or semi-sweet chocolate will only have sweetener /    sugar in some form added, and may also include a touch of soy lecithin    as an emulsifier. These brands are milk-free by ingredients, but keep    in mind that most brands of chocolate are made on shared equipment.    That is, an inherently milk-free dark chocolate may be made on the    same equipment as milk chocolate. See below for my note on    cross-contamination issues.   The complications arrive as some brands of dark and semi-sweet    chocolate do include milk ingredients for a “smoother” end result.    This is particularly true in mainstream brands like Hershey’s. Some    ways that you may see milk listed in the ingredients include milk    solids, milk, milk powder, whey, butter oil or butterfat (see the Ask    Alisa post on butter oil), or even casein. If milk is in the    ingredients, it should be listed in a clearly identifiable manner per    the labeling laws, but still, use caution.    This is still in line with the information I provided, as I did mention ""other flavorings"" in dark chocolate, and it is not a universal or even common practice as far as I know.  For people with strong allergies, the cross-contamination issue may be more of an issue.  Vegans would have more of an issue, as lecithen is a very common ingredient in chocolate of all types, and may be animal sourced.  Vegans would specifically need to reseearch and obtain chocolates that meet that standard.   Googling will find many such products, but I did not find an easy single reference list.

Would using milk powder better than fresh milk when poaching?,"Poaching is a gentle process - the milk isn't boiling so there is no risk of it burning or the like.

Powdered milk would probably work, but if you have fresh, use that.  ",2,milk powder,fresh milk
"Which diploma, ATCL or dipABRSM","You need to think about why you want the qualification.    Do you want it as a pre-requisite for entry into an educational establishment?  Do you want it in order to get professional work?  Do you just like collecting qualifications?    In all of these cases, I honestly believe the qualifications are pretty much equivalent. There aren't colleges or employers who would accept one qualification, but not the other. You might yourself think of one as having more prestige than the other - but that's a gut-feel Pepsi/Coke distinction that only you can evaluate.  However, don't take my word for it. Ask the employers and colleges that you're interested in what qualifications they look for.  Alternatively, you might not care for the certificate at the end, only being interested in the actual skills you learn in getting there. In that case you need to look at each syllabus in detail (they should be openly available), and see which one involves learning the skills you want to develop.  One big factor, is your teacher -- assuming you are using one. Your teacher may well have a preferred qualification, for which they know the syllabus, and with which they have experience teaching.

Which interface to choose for connecting my electric guitar to the computer?,"From the options you gave I suggest the first one.   To connect to the 3,5mm input is not a good option. There are several disadvantages & problems that might come up, the worst are latency, low sound quality and physical limitations with the 3,5 mm input. Latency means that when you play/record the audio interface might have a delay, late answer, in timing; which can be very annoying and frustrated when you are recording. It will make you play/record worst. The sound quality, sampling rate, conversion from analog to digital are also weak/poor quality and are also a downside that will make you disappointed.

What's the difference between alnico and ceramic pickups?,"This may not help a lot, but here is one person's opinion + facts about magnetic cores:  sonicwrench forum    Q: What is the difference between Alnico and ceramic magnets?  A: Alnico magnets are made of an alloy of Aluminum, Nickel, and    Cobalt. Ceramic magnets are made from ferrites (often iron oxides).    Magnetically speaking, ceramic magnets produce a stronger field than    Alnico. The result is a slightly hotter sounding pickup with more    treble response. A lot of people automatically say that Alnico is    superior to ceramic in pickups. Alnico tends to produce a very musical    pickup in most setups. However, there are fantastic sounding ceramic    pickups out there (such as the G&L “MFD” pickups), as well as our own    humbuckers and P90′s. The reason ceramic has a bad rap is probably due    to its use on low quality instruments, in low quality pickups. Ceramic    magnets are often useful in high-output pickups to help retain high    end that is lost due to overwinding, and help to create crunchy    sounding pickups for hard rock, heavy blues, and metal styles.    So like a lot of components in musical instruments, which is ""better"" depends on what you want for sound output.   ",0,alnico,ceramic pickups

When is it more productive to build your own framework than to use an existing one?,"Answer to why:    License issues  Company specific requirements that didn’t exist in current frameworks  The company wants to have control over support and maintenance of the framework  The architect didn't know better!

Enterprises need security because many of their application are business critical and also long lived. The cost of reinventing the wheel may be more in short terms. But the cost may be more if framework used in company application is deprecated and no longer supported, or licenses are changed.

Windows Phone 7 dev: C# or silverlight for a simple app?,"Ok, you're confusing technologies.    C# is a programming language  Silverlight is a framework and a runtime - you write Silverlight applications using C# (or VB or, possibly, other things - though you have to get creative).    If you want to write applications (apps) to run on a Windows Phone 7 device you almost certainly will write in C#, your choice is between Silverlight or XNA for the framework and from your description I'd guess that Silverlight would be the sensible choice. There are no other options for apps, though you could write a web based application tailored to the screen size.  Silverlight's UI is created using XAML and is a subset of WPF.  To answer the question, if you've got C# devs familiar with the .NET framework then you're at least halfway there. Yes, Silverlight is the right solution. Silverlight developers are, for the most part, C# developers - but C# devs familiar with XAML and UI development - though you can put Expression Blend in the hands of a suitable designer and have them to the UI.  I'd suggest that you want to have your team understanding and taking advantage of MVVM as defined by Microsoft because that's how they feel that Silverlight dev should be doen and therefore they've put things in place to make that possible.

Need advice: Staying techie or going the MBA way?,"My  personal experience is 25 years being a developer or technical things over a wide range (my experience is s/w + h/w + all sorts). I've done bits of project management and so on along the way as well.  There are a few points I can make:    If you have the technical skills and ability and like what you do then your challenge is to stay current and relevant, technically.  If you move off to something else where you chase the $ but don't like it, you will be filled with regret, and hate what you are doing. Its common to live the lifestyle that comes with a bigger paycheck and so you struggle to go back to what you like that pays less.  In all my years in technology I've come across only 1 person who benefited from doing an MBA. They didn't finish but learned enough about project cost accounting and tracking to spot the early signs of a project running off the rails. THIS PART OF AN MBA is about 3 months or less of the total. [AND everyone else who had done an MBA was a dangerous fool.]  Some of the most switched on, savvy business people I know have never done an MBA. And I know one who started and gave up in disgust, his view was summed up as ""If I did this crap in my business I'd go broke"". Except he was a lot blunter.    I've been pushed to do an MBA on and off over the last 15 years, and procrastination was the best thing I ever did.   If you really want to broaden your horizons then pick off some courses on project management and project cost tracking. Put your peril-sensitive sunglasses on and have your bullshit detector finely tuned. Listen and think and pick out the good bits rather than slavishly following the advice.  And then go buy the following books:    ""Slack"" and ""Peopleware"" and ""The Deadline"" - All by De Marco. You will find good prices from The Book Depository or Amazon.  ""The Goal"" by Eli Goldratt.     Read these and have a huge big think (especially about the differences between them, and how the principles from ""The goal"" might apply to s/w development - its not what you might first think). You'll probably learn more from these than any MBA will ever teach you.  Unfortunately many MBA people have no other experience, or no real-world experience in what they try to manage. They exemplify a modern belief that to manage something you don't need to know the work, even the technical domain. All you are doing after all is managing. Sadly, nothing could be further from the truth. Managers with this view, puffed up by an MBA, are dangerous. Check out what urban dictionary has to say about LOMBARD and you'll know what I mean.

Is Flash really superior to Java applets?,"Flash provides a more seamless experience for the user. Java applets are pretty slow, since the Java VM needs to be fired up before they can run. As a website visitor, I hate it when things freeze for a few moments while the Java VM figures itself out. If I'm not mistaken, it also doesn't unload once I navigate away from the website that used it, leaving it hanging around when I didn't really want it to run in the first place.  My (admittedly limited) experience with Flash and applet development also tells me that developing an animation in Flash is easier.  And then there's history. Microsoft didn't do Java applets any favours by developing their own JVM and making it behave differently from Sun's. As a result, the same applet could work in one browser and not another, which made creating Java applets less viable.  Java does have free tools that can be used as opposed to proprietary Flash editors required to make Flash videos, but ultimately its heavy-handed approach makes it inferior.   ",1,Flash,Java applets
Advantages of Ubuntu LTS versions over regular Ubuntu?,"From the Releases page on the wiki:    Ubuntu releases are supported for 18    months.

What has more impact on performance: Readyboost or paging file on a system with 2GB RAM?,"Regarding page files, Mark Russinovich (pretty much the expert on Windows in everyway) wrote an article that can be found here: [REF]    He finds that turning the pagefile off is a huge mistake. The key quote is probably:    Perhaps one of the most commonly asked    questions related to virtual memory    is, how big should I make the paging    file? There’s no end of ridiculous    advice out on the web and in the    newsstand magazines that cover    Windows, and even Microsoft has    published misleading recommendations.    Almost all the suggestions are based    on multiplying RAM size by some    factor, with common values being 1.2,    1.5 and 2. Now that you understand the role that the paging file plays in    defining a system’s commit limit and    how processes contribute to the commit    charge, you’re well positioned to see    how useless such formulas truly are.  Since the commit limit sets an upper    bound on how much private and    pagefile-backed virtual memory can be    allocated concurrently by running    processes, the only way to reasonably    size the paging file is to know the    maximum total commit charge for the    programs you like to have running at    the same time. If the commit limit is    smaller than that number, your    programs won’t be able to allocate the    virtual memory they want and will fail    to run properly.  So how do you know how much commit    charge your workloads require? You    might have noticed in the screenshots    that Windows tracks that number and    Process Explorer shows it: Peak Commit    Charge. To optimally size your paging    file you should start all the    applications you run at the same time,    load typical data sets, and then note    the commit charge peak (or look at    this value after a period of time    where you know maximum load was    attained). Set the paging file minimum    to be that value minus the amount of    RAM in your system (if the value is    negative, pick a minimum size to    permit the kind of crash dump you are    configured for). If you want to have    some breathing room for potentially    large commit demands, set the maximum    to double that number.    ",0,Readyboost,paging file

Should I use NUMA or SMP with Vista 64-bit?,"Last question first: Yes, Vista does support NUMA (XP professional already did)   In most cases it is beneficial to use the hardwares' native memory mode. 'Optimal' memory bandwidth and latentcy is the result.    The modes access policies can be descibed as follows:  NUMA: use local memory first (fast), if full use foreign (slow)  SMP: map every other memory page to the other CPU, this averages out fast and slow memory access   There are only rare cases where the application access foreign memory in a way that SMP modes averaging out the memory access is beneficial for the overall performance.  Example: Database, that doesn't exceed the memory capabilities of the system but still using significantly more than locally available memory.  If you don't care about memory performance you could have saved the money for the expensive i7 and buy a much cheaper (old style) SMP system and spend the extra money for a team dinner ;-)  ",1,NUMA,SMP
Intel CPU: Core 2 Duo vs. Xeon Dual Core. Which is faster?,"SPEC is always a good reference for this kind of thing.  Here are their data for those two CPUs.  SPEC's result numbers are a ratio of the performance of the system to that of a Sun Ultra Enterprise 2.  Roughly, the computer tested is ""result"" times faster than a UE2.  Since all computers are referenced from that one benchmark, you can divide the results from two different computers and find their relative performances.  The CINT benchmark is integer-math based and the CFP benchmark is floating-point based.  The ""Rate"" benchmarks test a fully loaded system and the non-""Rate"", ""Speed"", benchmarks test a single process.  That is, how fast can it do one thing versus how fast can it do a bunch of things at once.  You can find more data about SPEC's benchmarks on their web site, including information on the CPU2006 benchmark.  The Xeon is slightly faster, despite its slower clock speed.  This is probably due to the Xeon's on-die memory controller, and the fact that it has HyperThreading, as shown by the fact that its ""Rate"" benchmarks show a greater improvement over the Core2 than the ""Speed"" benchmarks.

Bluetooth versus Wireless for VoIP,"(Edited answer)  If your computer already has bluetooth, I would go for the bluetooh one as it means no additional device needed. If you do not have Bluetooth, I would go with the Microsoft adapter as I find the hardware generally very good and that headset looks nice!    General advice for wireless V bluetooth headsets-  Typically, if I understand you, a Bluetooth VOIP phone would be a simple headset/microphone that connects to a computer and needs a driver / third party software to actually connect to a VOIP provider.  A Wireless VOIP device will simply be straight on to your network without requiring any other computer device. You put the VOIP settings straight into it.  Again, without knowing model numbers or more info, it is hard to tell - I am just talking about a typical Bluetooth headset and a wireless VOIP phone.  ",0,Bluetooth,Wireless

"Mexico to Tierra de Fuego, bus or own car?","The choice is about: freedom of movement vs hassle & costs.  The good thing about your own vehicle is that it will take you wherever you want to go, whenever you want to go. Even to the places that are not served by public transport. The downside is that crossing borders with a car increases hassle, this will be most notable when shipping your car around the Darien Gap.  The good thing about using public transport is that is easy and (likely) more expensive*.  *) Although public transport is considerably more expensive per mile traveled, I calculated that the costs for shipping (+handlings and border duties) around the Darien Gap is a big factor in the overall costs of doing this trip with your own vehicle. So driving your own vehicle may turn out to be more expensive. The more miles you travel, the cheaper driving your own vehicle will be. I did my calculations for 2 people, so I estimate it would turn out to be cheaper to drive your own car, if you do the calculations for 3 people.  Most travelers I talked to told me that by selling a car in the south that you bought in the north, you will likely not lose too much money, maybe even make a small profit.

Why are round-trip car rentals much cheaper than one-way car rentals?,"There are elements of truth in most of the other answers, but as a 16-year veteran of the rental car industry in the US, I'll toss my take into the mix.  Most of the time when you're searching, the answer is: ""because they can.""  What I mean by that is that the whole ""well, someone has to drive it back to the renting office"" is not actually the case. That's because most rental offices in mid-size and larger cities are corporate-owned, and all three of the big-name rental companies that operate the eight major brands (Avis, Budget, Enterprise, Alamo, National, Hertz, Dollar, and Thrifty) now use a ""floating fleet"" model, which means that the companies maintain a nationwide single fleet and any car can be assigned to and rented from any location at any time.  So if someone rents a car at Avis LAX and returns it at Avis in Austin, the car simply gets washed by the detailing crew at Avis Austin, placed in a parking stall at Avis Austin, and assigned to the next Avis Austin customer who comes in to pick up that size car. The same thing happens if they rent at Avis LAX and return at Avis in downtown Los Angeles or Avis in Midtown Manhattan or Avis at Chicago Midway airport. That's why a large number of license plates on any corporate-owned rental lot tend to be from out of state.  Now, of course, for every person who picks up in LAX and returns elsewhere, there's usually someone renting elsewhere and returning in LAX, so the fleet tends to stay pretty balanced. That's why I say they charge the one-way fee ""because they can""--because there really isn't a hard cost to them. Cars go out, cars come in, and all is good. But the market (supply, demand, and competition) allows them to charge a premium price for one-way rentals, so even though there's no (or a very minimal) direct expense associated with these kinds of one-way rentals, they do it because they can.  Of course, sometimes one-way flows do result in an imbalanced fleet. If LAX loses too many cars and they have fewer cars than they forecast needing to meet demand, then they do have to arrange for cars to be brought back from somewhere else. So sometimes it is necessary to truck a load or ten of cars in from elsewhere, and that does have a cost, so collecting one-way fees allows them to cover those costs.  It's worth mentioning that seasonal demand can have some interesting effects. I've taken advantage of the fall ""Florida Drive-In"" specials, where picking a car up in the Northeast and dropping it off in Florida can net some extremely attractive rates ($5-10 per day or so)--cheaper than a standard round-trip rental! This helps the rental car companies move cars from the colder northern states (where demand slacks off in the winter) to the warmer southern states (where winter is peak season). It's much cheaper to have people drive cars down for you than to pay a car carrier to haul it down by truck or, even worse, to have cars sit idle in the north while offices in the south buy or lease extra cars to meet demand. (There's also the related Florida Drive-Out special that takes place in the spring and some less-lucrative similar offerings out west.) So it's not always true that one-way rentals are more expensive!  As well, there are certain places where one-way fees seem to be very reasonable or even not charged. One answer mentioned rentals in Germany--that's a place where one-way fees seem not to be part of the local rental culture, unless you try to drop the car off outside of Germany. Intra-Florida rentals are often quite cheap (due to a ton of competition--it's the largest rental car market in the world and there are literally dozens of rental car companies that operate at Florida's major airports), and intra-California one-ways are frequently not charged fees, too (that's because the one-way flows between places like Los Angeles and San Francisco are pretty balanced--as many people are interested in driving up Highway 1 as are interested in driving down Highway 1, I suppose), so that, combined with the high volume and competition, lends itself to reasonably-priced one-way rentals.  Now, when it comes to franchised locations, one-way fees are based much more in the realities of rental car logistics. If a car owned by a licensee location (typically found at smaller, more rural airports or in some smaller towns) ends up far away from its base, there are hard costs to deal with that situation. The best option is for the receiving location to rent the car back to its owning location on a paid one-way rental, but there's no guarantee of that happening quickly, and the owning location loses the potential revenue of the car they paid for until it gets back into the fleet. Failing that, the owning location has to pay to have the car transported back home, either by car carrier or by sending an employee to go retrieve the car--not a small cost. And in a worst case situation, the least-bad solution is for the owning location to simply sell the car to the receiving location, but that's obviously not without its own costs and logistical headaches.  In these cases with franchised locations, the one-way fees are actually intended to be punitive and dissuade people from choosing that option, but they also cover the rental agency's costs if someone does require a one-way rental.  I should also address a couple of topics with one-way fees. Most rental car agencies now don't quote an explicit, broken-out one-way drop fee, instead baking the one-way fee into the rate itself. For example, a standard round-trip rental in Portland might run you $40 per day, but if you quote a reservation for a one-way to Seattle, it might balloon up to $100 per day. However, some companies, as well as some booking channels (usually prepaid brokers), still break the fee out (for the hypothetical Portland rental, both the round-trip and one-way rentals would price out at $40 per day, but the one-way would have a $100 drop fee attached).  The former model works best for short rentals, while the latter is more advantageous for longer rentals. In the Portland example, if you can do your one-way drive in a single day, the included one-way is cheaper (a net extra charge of $60). But if you're going to take a week to drive the Washington coastline, the weekly rate would balloon from a couple hundred bucks to north of $500. With a separately-itemized $100 drop fee, you'd pay the same fee even if you kept the car for a month. In any case, the best thing to do is just plug your dates and locations into a search engine that searches all rental companies at once and choose the one that displays the cheapest total price (ignore the base rate and pay attention instead to the total with all taxes and fees).  Mileage fees are sometimes charged, but they're more common with franchises. However, sometimes you'll see them applied at major locations depending on what kind of discount code you use. For example, the USAA discount code with Hertz returns very attractive rates even on long-distance one-ways until you notice the catch: an almost punitive mileage fee that can total hundreds of dollars. Unless you're literally just driving across town, mileage-based one-way fees are rarely the best option.  ",1,round-trip car rentals,one-way car rentals
Why is Mumbai - London - Dallas - Denver more expensive than Bangalore - Mumbai - London - Dallas - Denver?,"See our question on hidden city ticketing.    From PriceofTravel, on why it happens:    Airfare pricing is extremely complicated and often an airline has the    choice of running certain segments at a loss by discounting seats, or    a bigger loss by flying mostly empty with higher fares. They need to    get their planes back into the more profitable positions on their    route map, so they discount heavily only when they have to, and    they’ll balance that with profits on routes that other airlines aren’t    bothering with at all.    So perhaps at this time of year, Bangalore to Mumbai can be easily discounted for a small loss by the airline, and then get more bodies onto the pricier flights, making them always have full planes there, and this works out as less of an issue for them than just making the Mumbai->Denver routes cheaper.  Sometimes when the last segment is the pricey one, and you're only going to say, B instead of C, on a A-B-C route, it's sometimes cheaper to buy the longer, cheaper flight and throw away the last ticket. Of course, this doesn't work if you need to get to C.  We have several questions on this (search throwing away, or not taking tickets).   As an example, a friend bought a Bolivia->Chile return flight, because it was cheaper than the one-way flight. He just threw away the second ticket :) Airlines do frown on it, however...  I also recommend that PriceofTravel article on Hidden Ticketing for a longish read anyway, it's quite eye-opening.  ",2,Mumbai - London - Dallas - Denver,Bangalore - Mumbai - London - Dallas - Denver

"Which one is more beneficial, working independently or collaborating with other researchers?","I'm trying to coin a phrase: interior point maximum.  Well, the phrase already exists: it means that the function you are trying to maximize which is defined on some closed, bounded interval [a,b] does not have its maximum value at either a or b but rather at some point c somewhere strictly in between.    Most functions one studies in calculus have interior point maxima, though there are obvious exceptions: especially if the function is increasing its maximum is at b, and if it is decreasing its maximum is at a.  Perhaps this is because the methods of calculus only speak to interior point maxima: the basic observation is that if the function is differentiable, an interior maximum must occur at a stationary point, i.e., for which the instantaneous rate of change is zero.  (Famously, the converse is not true.)  What's the point of this math lesson?  It's this: when we step outside of math class we tend to completely forget about this phenomenon and try to stare off into space and figure out which of the two extreme points, a and b, is better.  But in many real-world situations it is actually pretty obvious that the maximum must be at an interior point.  To me at least, the current question is a case of this.    If you never collaborate, then you never benefit from anyone else's expertise.  In research we almost never do exactly what we want: rather we collect various pieces of what we want to do, and then have to make hard choices about how and when to combine those pieces into published work.  If you can find someone else whose pieces are complementary to your pieces, then you both benefit tremendously form collaboration, because academia (justly) rates complete solutions more than twice as highly as half solutions.  This is, to me, the best argument for collaboration, and it already shows that ""no collaboration"" is not going to be your optimal choice.    Another argument for collaboration, not nearly as good, is that it allows you to increase your multiplicity: in a given year, maybe you can write one paper all by yourself, or maybe you can write one fourth of four papers and put your name on all of them.  In some academic cultures, depending upon how you play it, you will get more credit with the second option.  However, there is no inherent advantage to this -- in other words, there is no added value to those outside your circle of collaborators -- so this is really rather specious.  (But it works, to a certain extent...unfortunately.)  Another legitimate benefit of collaboration is that your collaborators get to know you and know your skills.  I have several collaborators that don't write as many papers as I do and are perhaps not as high-profile in the community as I am.  I wouldn't have thought they were anything special if I hadn't worked with them -- worked with them because they brought to the table key pieces that I could use to advance my work.  Whenever anyone asks me about these people, I say how great they are.  If you always collaborate, then people begin to wonder whether you can in fact write a paper / complete an experiment / do one unit of substantial academic work by yourself.  If you always collaborate with the same people, and especially if they are more senior than you and/or have other papers without you, then a lot of hard-nosed academics [including me] are going to suspect that you are not the brains of the operation and eventually wonder whether you may not have been gifted coauthorship.  The details of this must be entirely field dependent, but I am in a field in which senior people usually don't get added as coauthors unless their intellectual contribution was decisive [in many cases, this means most decisive], so if I see someone with a sequence of strong papers all of which are joint with their eminent thesis advisor and no others, then I really need to hear their thesis advisor describe specifically and cogently the value added by their student.  (In some fields collaboration is not an option, it's a reality.  But this seems to nullify the question: if a = b, you can maximize the function.)  So it seems clear that it's an interior point maximum: it will be best for your research if you collaborate x% of the time for some 0 < x < 100.  As with all interior maxima, one way to figure out x is: take a rough guess as to what you think a good value of x would be, and then explore the nearby space.  Definitely do at least one collaborative work and at least one solo work and then evaluate how they went.  At the risk of ruining my meme, I will say though that in this case the amount of collaboration is less important -- if you make it safely between 0 and 100% -- than the type of collaboration.  As above, you want to choose collaborations that qualitatively augment your work.  You do not want to ""trade papers"" or get involved in projects just to have your name on one more paper.  Definitely make sure that you are bringing something to the table whenever you collaborate: you really don't want people wondering whether you've added anything of value.

which one have more importance to US PhD program ?TOEFL and GRE or publication records,"Neither.  PhD admissions committees at strong departments are looking for clear evidence of potential for high-quality independent research.  Test scores only matter if they're low.  In particular, if your math score is low, there will be serious doubts about your math ability, and if your verbal/TOEFL score is low, there will be serious questions about your communication skills.  In some departments (like mine in CS), admission to the PhD requires a TOEFL Speak score above a certain minimum (in my case: 22), because all PhD students are expected to be TAs at least once while they're in the program, and the state of Illinois requires a minimum Speak score (in my case: 24) on TAs who are not native English speakers.  Publication records only matter if the papers are either good or horrible.  It's utterly impossible to tell from the number of publications whether the applicant has significant promise for future independent research.  High-quality papers, written in flawless English, published in well-known venues that are easily accessible online from the US, are definitely helpful.

Most students don't have a choice between either doing research over the summer or doing it during the year. As long as it doesn't interfere with your grades or other activities, more research is always a good thing, no matter when it happens.  That said, in my experience you should simply have a conversation with your professor (or direct supervisor, who will often be a grad student or post-doc) about time commitment and expectations. No one expects you to do the same amount of work in 10-15 hrs/week that you might do in 30 hrs/week, and no one expects you to work full-time while taking a full course load. As with many things in life, just make sure to communicate about expectations.   ",0,to do undergraduate research in the summer,during the school year
Is co-first author or co-corresponding author better for a postdoc's job prospects?,"I would say co-first author:    First authorship is more important: if a professor both led the work and made the biggest contribution to the paper, they will generally choose first authorship rather than last authorship.  Early in your career, making a big contribution to the research itself is likely to be most important, and first authorship shows that.  The ""last author"" signifying the leader of the work is less widespread (one discussion here).  Even in fields that use this convention, it is not always used.  Thus, your last authorship might not mean as much.  Especially if someone knows you are not a professor leading your own lab, they might not give you much credit for this.  ""co-first authorship"" is a clear idea: you are one of two people who equally made the largest contributions to the work.  But ""co-last authorship"" is not so clear.  What does it mean?  Especially if the other last author is the professor who runs the lab?  It's not clear what this would say about your contribution.    Of course this is referring to fields where authorship ranking by contribution is used; this isn't universal.  ",1,co-first author,co-corresponding author

So in the mobile space, depending upon exactly how much hardware you want to use, HTML5/CSS3/JS is a prerfectly good option.  With Windows 8, there's going to be HTML5 apps in the new tablet view, but native apps are still very much the core part of the experience (Visual Studio won't be HTML5 for example...I don't think).  However, since the markup/JS is hardware accelerated it can now be every bit as fast as a native application.  To your point about if Flash and Silverlight have a place - Windows Phone 7's UI is based on Silverlight, so I'm sure it'll be around for a while.  Also, these technologies are still the only way to get a rich web media experience on older browsers like IE7, which are still very much alive in the XP world.  Until every user you want to view something is off of that, you'll need a fallback method.  Flash is still great for that with video and graphics.

Traditional ASP.Net WebForms vs ASP.Net MVC,"It seems only natural that Microsoft will try to push mvc adoption for ASP.NET, to catch up with the competition. Since the early days of ASP.NET MVC, most articles on ASP.NET on MSDN Magazine seem to feature the framework as do most articles from the news and community content section of asp.net.   I consider the above strong hints, but nothing more. Even if pushing the mvc approach is evident, that doesn't mean that the event driven approach will stop being focal to ASP.NET anytime soon. Microsoft were extremely late in adopting MVC so they are now pushing hard to fill the blanks.  Also note that I'm not suggesting that event-driven is bad and mvc is good. Both architectures have their valid uses and distinct merits. What was pretty bad, was that up until recently there wasn't an easy way to implement mvc on ASP.NET so people would have to get extra creative with the event driven approach in cases where mvc would be more appropriate.  So, no I don't see Microsoft giving up the event driven approach in favor of mvc, it doesn't make sense.  ",0,Traditional ASP.Net WebForms,ASP.Net MVC
What are the relative advantages of dictionaries versus databases?,"If you want to know whether there is a performance advantage, the best thing to do is measure it yourself. The performance depends a lot on the type of data, the language, the amount of data, etc.   It's impossible to give a blanket statement as to when dictionaries are better than databases. Again, it depends on the data, the language, etc. Roughly speaking, dictionaries are better for simple and small datasets, and databases are good for complex and large data sets.

What are graph datastores better at doing than other datastores and why?,"Highly connected graphs are not easy to model or query using relational databases.  Think about social graphs - Bob is a friend to Alice, Alice is a friend to Carol.   How many friends of friends does Bob have?  Modelling and querying this kind of data is what graph datastores are good at.  Another example - think about Dr Who episodes and a corpus of data about all the actors, characters and sets used in them. In a graph datastore you could query all the episodes an actor was in a specific set with a specific character - this is not easy to model or query in relational database.

Is it better to build HTML Code string on the server or on the client side?,"Server-side    Pros: More controllable, easier to debug, less dependent on client's browser   Cons: More server load, higher network traffic and latency    Client-side    Cons: Depends on decent JS/DOM implementation in the browser.  Pros: Performance, performance, performance. Less server load (thus faster server response), much less network traffic, and thanks to previous two much less latency.    For example LinkedIn's Engineering Team article   ""Blazing fast node.js: 10 performance tips from LinkedIn Mobile"" as one of the points talks about that issue.

creative & complex vs simple and readable,"Your second version IS far more simple and readable, and much better in every way. It's not creative or complex, but perfectly normal, straightforward code.  The only way in which it might confuse newbies is that it requires them to understand that complex boolean expressions are A) still expressions like any other and B) can be used wherever a boolean value is required, rather than just inside an if clause.  But this is something newbies really need to understand, so you should never let the possibility of someone not yet understanding it influence your code.  ",0,creative & complex,simple and readable
