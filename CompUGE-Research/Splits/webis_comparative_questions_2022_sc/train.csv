"conciseness [SEP] readability [SEP] Do you prefer conciseness or readability in your code? [SEP] Both.  Your first example is certainly more verbose, and arguably more explicit... but it also requires me to scan five lines instead of one. Worse, it deemphasizes its purpose - assigning a value to newGuy.Boss.  Your second example may cost me a second if I'm unfamiliar with the null coalescing operator, but there can be no doubt as to its purpose, and if I'm scanning through a larger routine looking for the source of a value, it will be much easier for me to pick this one out.  Now, contrast this:  if (boss == null) {      newGuy.Boss = GetDefaultBoss();      newGuy.IsTemp = true;      newGuy.AddTask(""orientation"");  } else {      newGuy.Boss = boss;      newGuy.IsTemp = false;  }    ...with:  newGuy.Boss = boss ?? GetDefaultBoss();  newGuy.IsTemp = boss == null;  if ( boss == null ) newGuy.AddTask(""orientation"");    The latter example is again much shorter, but now it obscures its purpose by making tasks triggered by the same test appear to be distinct. Here, I feel the verbosity of the former is justified.  ",1
"WCF [SEP] MVC3 controller with restful messages [SEP] Javascript client - which is likely to be better serverside? WCF or MVC3 controller with restful messages? [SEP] If the use case is pretty simple and you've already got to support a MVC site then I think MVC is a pretty good choice. I'd also generally agree that standard WCF is perhaps a bit too much ceremony and boilerplate and difficult to IoC in a sane and rational manner.   All that said, you might want to check out the WCF Web API. It is pretty simple to implement at first, plays well with your existing MVC site while also having some pretty powerful message handling facilities. Your typical MVC controllers start to fall down a bit -- or at least the level of complexity increases dramatically -- when you get into stuff like ETags, cache hinting and such. The Web API bridges that gap nicely and it is definitely worth checking out.  ",1
"doing a postdoc in Singapore [SEP] UK [SEP] What are the advantages and disadvantages of doing a postdoc in Singapore and UK? [SEP] To put the following into context, I teach at a UK university and have delivered courses at a Singapore partner university for many years.  In support of many of the above comments, you need have no concerns about the academic establishment in Singapore, at any level, from primary through to university. Education is top of Singapore's agenda and this is apparent everywhere. Teaching is in english throughout. Singapore's universities are world-class.  The living and working environments are excellent. Cost of living (apart from housing) is lower than UK. The transport system is also excellent.  Cost of accommodation is the only negative. Apartment rental costs are high - comparable to London. However, if you are appointed on expat terms the University will provide an apartment and the rent will be subsidised; all large companies that employ expat staff take account of accommodation costs. But you should make sure that you know what type of apartment is on offer and that it meets your family needs. 'Landed properties' form a very small part of Singapore's accommodation, the large majority are high-rise apartments.  Income tax is much lower than UK levels - you can check this out on the government's IRAS web page.  ",2
"ASP.Net [SEP] WPF(C#) [SEP] ASP.Net or WPF(C#)? [SEP] It certainly sounds to me like a WPF app, with lot's of user interaction and potentially interacting with hardware.  You can deliver the app via Click-Once so deployment is mostly a non-issue.  Your WPF app can access a WCF service and deliver the data as binary so the performace will be excellent.  I would start reading up on WPF and getting familiar with it as soon as possible.  ",3

"gazpacho [SEP] normal soups [SEP] What's the difference between gazpacho and normal soups? [SEP] Gazpacho is possibly Spain's most famous chilled soup. The main difference aside form the temperature is that it's raw, meaning that the soup is not actually cooked it's just blended and chopped vegetables and occasionally bread. There is nothing inherently wrong with heating up gazpacho but it would lose its fresh texture and flavour which is why it's chilled and according to Wikipedia was popular with labourers who used it to:    ""cool off during the summer and to use available ingredients such as fresh vegetables and stale bread""    The main reason you couldn't just chill a normal soup and call it gazpacho is because gazpacho is made up of by no means just tomato. It contains tomatoes, a bit of garlic, cucumber, occasionally bread, some vinegar for tang and a drizzle of olive oil at the end.  If you wanted to make it your own (after all you're the chef!) you could add some Tabasco, bell peppers, spring onions or croutons at the end, basically anything you might find in a salsa dip. Use your common sense for what not to add but even in Spain they have variations that are not at all like what I would think of as gazpacho: in La Mancha they use it like a stew and add game (usually rabbit) and even wild mushrooms!  Hope this helps and gives you some inspiration, if you want a recipe a quick search on Google gives a multitude of results.  ",0
"on Friday the 13th [SEP] regular Fridays or 13ths [SEP] Are flights (generally) cheaper on Friday the 13th, compared to regular Fridays or 13ths? [SEP] Apparently there seem to be some studies that say that there's a drop in flight inquires (often cited in articles is a study of Jetcost.co.uk that says it drops by something between 24 and 27%). Another study by kayak.com seems to show that the prices are between 5 and 15% lower.  However, I don't know how serious those studies were as I couldn't find the original documents. They might not control for factors like overall drop/increase in flight demand, for instance. Also this is probably an effect that would only affect Western countries, where the superstition around 13 exists and not so much if you were to travel to Asia, for instance.  ",2

"pizza sauce [SEP] spaghetti sauce [SEP] What is the difference between pizza sauce and spaghetti sauce? [SEP] Red pizza sauce is often (but not always) two things:    Thicker.  Thinner sauce will tend to run in the oven and also steam the pizza crust as it cooks - if loaded with toppings, otherwise thin is fine.  Depending on the crust, the heat of the oven, the toppings above sauce, and how watery it is, this may not be needed.  If you've just got some crushed tomatoes and a few bits of cheese in a super hot oven - the sauce should be fine without reducing beforehand.  If you've loaded up a bucket of sauce and a pound of cheese, precook and reduce the sauce.  It's often simpler.  Many pasta dishes like spaghetti highlight the sauce and hours of simmering happen for the sauce to bring it to perfection.  They're all about the sauce.  Pizza is really about the crust and what highlights it.  Many of the best pizzas are simply topped.  Crushed san marzano tomatoes (sometimes) reduced with a hint of salt is often all I do, and franky, it's enough. I'm not talking about the jarred varieties here, but what you might cook at home.  Jars in the store, the main difference is just how thick it is.    ",0

"Apache Solr [SEP] non-Java competition [SEP] How much better is Apache Solr than its non-Java competition? [SEP] Don't know anything about Sphinx, but both Solr and Zend_Search_Lucene are based on Lucene (to be precise, Solr uses Lucene directly and Zend_Search is derived from Lucene). So at the bottom of either package you have the same solid and tested IR concepts. So in theory you can develop pretty much the same search engine using either package.  What is good about Solr is that is packed with a lot of features which save you a lot of time. For instance you can query Solr and have it send response in PHP serialize format, so you can get the results with simple unserialize() instead of parsing. You would have to develop all the bits yourself with Zend_Search.  ",2
"key-value [SEP] subject-predicate-object [SEP] Which is more fundamental: key-value or subject-predicate-object? [SEP] Following your simplicity argument (binary is more fundamental than octal), I'd say that key-value stores are more fundamental.  I think that Subject-Predicate is essentially a 'compound' or 'aggregate' key, so a subject-predicate-object store is a key-value store with additional requirements on the key (namely that it can be split into two).

"to attend a well-known undergrad program with advanced coursework [SEP] one where I can write a bachelors' thesis [SEP] For graduate admissions, is it better to attend a well-known undergrad program with advanced coursework or one where I can write a bachelors' thesis? [SEP] If I were you, I would try to move to B based on the assumption that B is better than A and A is probably less recognizable in the US than B schools.  You are right that research potential is an important factor the admission committees of top schools will pay attention to. However, bachelor thesis is not the only way to show that you can do research. You can do research papers with professors' supervision at school B if you want.  I suggest B since you can learn a lot more in B than in A. Building the foundations during undergrad stage is more important than doing research prematurely.   When you apply graduate schools, you need to provide GPA, GRE/TOEFL scores, recommendation letters and any evidence that you can do research.  One of the first things the admission committee will look at is your transcript to determine if you are competent in math. If you stay in A, all you can show is basic to intermediate level math courses. Given that all other conditions will be equal, i.e. you'll get the same GRE/TOEFL scores, about the same recommendation letters (I am not too sure about that), the only thing you can use to beat other applicants is your very good quality bachelor thesis. But, how can you write a very good thesis without having solid math knowledge?  Thus, I am suggesting B. I do understand how tough is the admission exam in that part of the world. It's bloody. Good luck!   ",3
"doughnut [SEP] krapfen [SEP] What is the difference between doughnut and krapfen? [SEP] There doesn't appear to be any difference.

There are so many variations of filling, topping, shape and so forth that it is hard to establish a single identity anyhow.  ",1
"Python threading [SEP] multiprocessing [SEP] Python threading vs. multiprocessing: Should I learn one before the other? [SEP] When you are starting out, it doesn't matter which one you choose. What is more important is getting a better understanding of how to parallelize work. If you don't have that base understanding, you will not be able to take advantage of the fine point that differentiate between the two.  Pick one and get used to thinking about what work can be done in parallel. Think about ways you can break a large task into smaller pieces. Think about what pieces of memory all the tasks need access to and if that value ever changes. Think about if it is ok if each task had it's own local value to change and if combining all of the local values at the end could prevent contention.  Once you think you have a handle on those types of things, than you can come back and look at the differences again. With a stronger understanding of concurrency, you will have better understanding of how the two methods differ.  ",1

"a logarithmic [SEP] a polynomial [SEP] Which bound is better, a logarithmic or a polynomial with arbitrarily small degree? [SEP] Since $\log n = O(n^{\epsilon})$ for an $\epsilon > 0$, if you can prove an approximation ratio of $O(\log n)$, then approximation ratios of $O(n^{\epsilon})$ (for any $\epsilon > 0$) immediately follow. You should always prove the best approximation ratio that you can, unless:    The best approximation ratio holds only in expectation, and some other approximation ratio holds with high probability.  You have several incomparable approximation ratios (this is more common in expressions involving more than one parameter).    That is, your worse guarantee needs to have some advantage over your better guarantee for you to report both.  Regarding practical performance, you are highlighting the fact that asymptotic performance can be misleading when it comes to evaluating algorithms in practice. The most well-known instance is probably ""fast"" matrix multiplication, which is usually slower than the trivial algorithm. Here you have two options:    Prove non-asymptotic guarantees on the approximation ratio, say $100\log n$ and $(2/\epsilon)n^{\epsilon}$. This allows you to obtain concrete guarantees for every $n$.  Do experiments. The experiments reveal the actual approximation ratio on the average. If you can fit your results to a nice function, you can say that empirically, the average approximation ratio is (say) $10\log n$, though in the worst case all you know is (say) $100\log n$. Experiments, however, are not so welcome in theoretical papers, unfortunately.    ",1

"Integrated Graphics [SEP] Dedicated Video Card [SEP] Integrated Graphics vs Dedicated Video Card on laptops [SEP] The core differences of integrated graphics processors (IGPs) vs dedicated video cards (GPUs) are :    IGPs uses significantly less power and generate less heat than GPUs  IGPs uses/shares main system memory whereas GPUs have dedicated memory  IGPs are performs significantly lower compared to GPUs (especially Intel IGP solutions)  On a desktop, if an IGP breaks down, you can't replace it short of replacing the whole motherboard. However, if a GPU break down, you can replace just the GPU alone.    So when you should consider one or the other? I'll try to make your decision simple.    Games/Performance > If your priority is in playing 3D games or high-performance computing, get a dedicated GPU.  Battery Life/Heat > If you are more concerned about having a notebook that can stay away from the mains, and won't fry your lap with heat, get an IGP.  Desktop/Notebook > If you are on a desktop, get a GPU (even a cheap one, such as the Nvidia 9400 or the ATI 4350). If you are looking to purchase a notebook, consider the above 2 points.    Personally, I predominantly game on consoles and my iPhone nowadays. If you are going to get a notebook, try to see if you can get one with the Nvidia 9400M chipset (IGP, but damn fine performance for an IGP solution).

"Item lookaheads [SEP] dot lookaheads [SEP] Item lookaheads versus dot lookaheads for $LR(k)$ with $k \gt 1$? [SEP] I think you are mistaken, they are needed but the dot look-ahead there is so obvious that you have not paid attention to the fact it is used.  First, let's remark that there are three kinds of items:    those in which the dot is just before a non-terminal. They never participate in an ambiguous situation: when a non-terminal has been produced, it is shifted.  those in which the dot is at the end. They have the item look-ahead and the dot look-ahead which are equal (what may follow the dot is what may follow the produced non-terminal when the production is reduced as the dot is at the end of the item).  those in which the dot is just before a terminal.  They have the item look-ahead and the dot look-ahead which are different.  The item look-ahead is what may follow the non-terminal when the production is reduced, the dot look-ahead start by the terminal which follow the dot and continue with what can be generated after that terminal.    Now, with a look-ahead of 1 or less, the dot look-ahead is trivial: either it is the item look-ahead or the terminal which is just after the dot and that's what you are using to solve a conflict (or decide that there is no way with the limited look-ahead you have).  With a look-ahead of 2 or more, you have to compute the dot look-head or you may not know if you have to shift or to reduce as in the example provided by Grune and Jacobs:  $$\begin{array}{l}  S \rightarrow Aa \; | \; Bb \;| \;Cec \;|\; Ded \\  A \rightarrow qE \\  B \rightarrow qE \\  C \rightarrow q \\  D \rightarrow q \\  E \rightarrow e \\  \end{array}$$  which has the state:  $$\begin{array}{lcc}  &\textrm{item look-ahead}&\textrm{dot look-ahead}\\  A \rightarrow q \cdot E & a\#  & ea\\  B \rightarrow q \cdot E & b \# & eb\\  C \rightarrow q \cdot   & ec   & ec\\  D \rightarrow q \cdot   & ed   & ed\\  E \rightarrow \cdot e   & a \# & ea\\  E \rightarrow \cdot e   & b \# & eb\\  \end{array}$$  ",1

"problem solving genius [SEP] language guru [SEP] Programming skills, problem solving genius or language guru? [SEP] You see, people usually experience feelings, and sometimes those feelings are a barrier to do the most important thing: team work.  There are those who have excellent problem solving skills, and those who manage to remember all the tiny little deatails of every language. And over the years I've met people having one and lacking the other, and vice versa.   I once worked with someone having superior problem solving skills. He'd participate in programming contests acheiving excellent results. He was a star programmer.  But then, working with him on a team as a partner on daily basis was more than just complicated. His ""team work"" skills were something like ""the rest of the team cheering him to do all the work"".  Then I moved jobs and met the Architect. He knew all the Desing Patterns by memory, creating tons of layers of abstraction just because ""It makes sense to keep things separarted"", leading to an over engineered solution twice the size of a more simpler one.   And again, instead of communicating his ""solution"" to the rest, he'd open Eclipse and write all the code by himself, just because it was ""easier"".  Finally I met Q. He wasn't as smart as the first one, nor he knew all the desing patters like the Architect. But he'd code like a machine, creating elegant and simple solutions.   His most notorius skill was explaining things, a skill the other two completely lacked.  ",1

"a teaching assistant [SEP] an instructor [SEP] What is the difference between a teaching assistant and an instructor? [SEP] No, there really is no universal definition of the terms; I have been a ""teaching assistant"" and an ""instructor"" at the same school for basically the same position.  The only thing that I would say is that the term ""teaching assistant"" tends to imply a position that does not have significant lecturing responsibilities, although she may be responsible for nearly everything else in the course (creating and grading homework and exam problems, interacting with students, conducting recitations sections, and so on). Note that this does not mean that the TA might not carry out a ""spot lecture"" or two; but this is not an expectation of the position overall.   In general, I would avoid this problem by doing two things:    Listing on my CV the ""job title"" that the school assigns to the role you carried out.  Provide a short list of the duties your position entailed.    In this way, there is no ambiguity or misconception that can result, since you're providing all the information needed to understand the breadth of your teaching experience.  ",1

"7/6 no 3 [SEP] 13 no 3, 9, 11 [SEP] 7/6 no 3 or 13 no 3, 9, 11; which chord name is more correct (if any)? [SEP] I wouldn't go with either of the names you suggested. When you use ""no"" chord notation typically you are changing the intended harmony of a chord to something the chord symbol was not ment to represent.   Let's look at what we have:   C G A Bb   I'm assuming the C is the bass note. It would  be a stretch to call this any type of C chord because not only is there no 3rd, but there is also no 2nd or 4th. There is very rarely a chord with an omitted 3rd that is not suspend.(Besides a power chord which this is not.)  If we look at this chord as some kind of A chord it makes much more sense because we can stack the chord in thirds now and have it make sense:  A C _ G Bb  We still have no 5th, but the 5th is commonly omitted in larger chords.  A to C makes a minor 3rd, the G is a minor 7th and the Bb is a b9. Because the C is in the bass, we will have to notate the chord in slash notation so we get:  Am7b9/C  Still a lengthy name, but it describes the function of the chord better than C13 no 3, 9, 11 where it is very odd to omit 3 notes in a chord.   Another thing to note is it is typical in a 13th chord to omit the 9th and 11th as they are optional. So the suggested name could be reduced to C13 no 3, but still it is odd to omit a 3rd without some kind of sus.  ",1

"liberal arts college [SEP] large research university [SEP] In which type of schools can I have better research experience in Biology, liberal arts college or large research university? [SEP] I went to a small liberal arts college and worked at a large university lab, that had undergraduate interns. From both experiences I agree that it is the lab and not the school that matters. However, there are conditions that you will be more or less likely to find, depending on the type of school. In general liberal arts colleges will give you more personal attention and large universities will have more resources. Funding at liberal arts colleges is focused on undergraduate education and funding at larger universities is focused on research.   Personal Attention:   Liberal arts: A lab is led by a principal investigator or PI. Liberal arts colleges often do not have graduate students or have few graduate programs. So, at a small liberal arts college you will work closely with your PI and get to know them well. I left my college with great letters of rec that helped me overcome a poor GPA (due to a medical problem in my first two years) and get into grad school.   University: The undergrads were trained by PhDs and post docs and had little contact with the faculty. Post docs and PhDs can often be great teachers, though, since they either are students or were students recently and might be able to anticipate the student's perspective. At a university, they will normally write your letters of recommendation and the faculty will sign them.   Independence:   Liberal Arts: All of our grants were training grants, so the emphasis was on teaching, as opposed to producing results. This means you will get to do more independent work. I got first hand experience with the equipment (EEG) and techniques (analysis of FMRI and EEG data) that few undergraduates get to use. Additionally, I know of at least two of my friends who published, as first authors, in major research journals. This is not uncommon in my school.   University: The undergrads had to learn a program that is no longer used by most labs in the field. There was little room for mistakes (all of the labs grants were research grants), so the undergrads were given the task of modifying previous work and really did not develop any understanding of how the program actually works. However, this lab was an older lab. I also believe students at an older lab at my undergraduate school had a similar experience, where the methodology they were taught was not consistent with current standards in the field.   Connections:  They are pretty equal in this area. Liberal arts college professors often collaborate with people at larger institutions and can connect you with other labs. I have friends who got summer jobs at Stanford and CalTech this way. At the large university, one of our undergrads got to go to Oxford for the summer, because of the professor's connections to a lab there.   Equipment and Resouces:   Liberal arts: We did not have access to some of the most expensive equipment (an MRI, for example). However, one of my professors also worked at a local university that had access to an MRI and we got to use it there. Ideally, you should get some lab experience at a major research university, so you are exposed to techniques that require more expensive equipment. You can do this during summer internships. Getting more experience at different labs will look good on your application.   On that note, a liberal arts college is more likely to have grants that will help students study at other institutions. My college had several such grants for student research grants. Additionally, all senior thesis was funded by the department. The senior thesis funding and one of the summer fellowships both require students to focus on their own original ideas. In most fields the first author is the person who had the idea for the project. This is how undergraduate students were able to become first authors.  University: Universities will have the best equipment, but they are less likely to have funding for student research. The institution I worked at had grants for students, but they were only for work at that university. They also had no specific grants that would allow students to propose their own projects, based on their own ideas.   ",1

"to use preprocessor directive [SEP] if(constant) statement [SEP] Is it better to use preprocessor directive or if(constant) statement? [SEP] I think there is one advantage of using a #define that you didn't mention, and that is the fact that you can set the value on the command line (thus, set it from your one-step build script).   Other than that, it is generally better to avoid macros. They don't respect any scoping and that can cause problems. Only very dumb compilers can't optimize a condition based on a compile-time constant. I don't know if that is a concern for your product (for example it might be important to keep the code small on embedded platforms).  ",3

"to play the keyboard standing [SEP] sitting [SEP] Is it better to play the keyboard standing or sitting? [SEP] It will always be easier to sit and operate pedals - the required uneven shift in weight from one foot to the other and holding it for extended periods can become quite tiring.  If your biggest concern is how it looks to the audience then yes, you'll probably have to put up with the discomfort and awkward stance of standing but there are a couple of things you can do to help:    Make sure the keyboard is set at a comfortable height (certainly don't leave it at sitting height!) and place the pedals relative to your playing position such that you don't have to lean excessively to operate them. If they're too far forward, you'll find yourself leaning backwards.  Use a bar stool or similar behind you to 'lean' against. That way, you can appear to be standing but you also have the support of a seat. Make sure it's sturdy and not on a slippery floor, else it may let you down when you come to rely on it!  If you're using a volume/expression pedal, get a 'balanced' one that holds its position so you don't have to keep your foot on it unless you're moving it.    ",1

"kosher chicken [SEP] brined chicken [SEP] In what way is kosher chicken different from brined chicken in terms of salt absorbtion? [SEP] I explained several of the differences in my answer to Brining a kosher bird and also discussed some issues relating to salt consistency in a much earlier answer to Chicken comes out salty... occasionally.  To make a long story short, kashering is a long process with many steps, but the part you're concerned with is similar to the ""dry brining"" technique some people are fond of using for Thanksgiving turkeys. The meat is salted directly - no water is used - and it is left to rest for a much shorter period, about 1 hour, before finally being rinsed and packed.  Kosher meat isn't ""juicy"" like brined meat at all; in fact, all other things being equal, it will come out much drier and tougher than unkosher meat, because in the process of drawing out blood (the reason for salting in kashering), a good deal of moisture is drawn out as well. Brining adds moisture to the tune of about 10%; kashering takes moisture away by a similar amount.  Aside from drying out, the only culinary differences you'll find with kosher birds (or other meat) are (a) less blood, uric acid, and other ""undesirable"" components, and (b) they are naturally saltier than unkosher birds. However, because the kashering process has nothing to do with flavouring, you can't expect any kind of consistency, and it's not uncommon to find that some parts are much saltier than other parts coming from the same bird.  Kosher birds are going to absorb roughly the same amount of salt and water from a brine. The difference is that because they've already been salted, you run the risk of over-brining to the point of being inedibly salty. That's the whole story.  If you want flavourful and moist then get a regular bird and brine it. If you care more about flavour and want to save some time (at a significant cost premium) then go ahead and use a kosher bird, no brine. You can brine a kosher bird (see first link in this answer) but you're going to have to do a little experimenting to get it right - and if you're going to brine anyway, then why bother spending the extra money on kosher meat?  Don't pay any mind to the oft-repeated claims that kosher birds are ""pre-brined"" or similar nonsense. The inherent saltiness of a kosher bird is significant but also incidental and thus inherently unreliable.  (Please also note: Assuming this is a follow-up to your previous question, none of this is going to make the slightest bit of difference if you're just going to plop the chicken parts into a pot of boiling or poaching water. If you're making broth, then you flavour the broth, not the meat.)  ",3

"visiting student [SEP] a non-degree seeking graduate student [SEP] Should I be a visiting student rather than a non-degree seeking graduate student? [SEP] Enrolling as a non-degree-seeking graduate student in a U.S. mathematics graduate program is almost never a good idea, and this is in no way a mainstream option.  (I'm talking about not seeking a degree anywhere.  For comparison, it's not uncommon to be officially seeking a degree at University X but visiting University Y while your advisor visits there.)  It's easy to get the wrong impression from course catalogs, since they give short descriptions of options that may not reflect how they are used in practice.  For example, I doubt the Princeton math department ever admits anyone as a qualifying student; if it happens at all, it is exceptionally rare.  I can imagine it might happen for a clearly brilliant student from a deprived background, but not for the vast majority of applicants.  There's just too much competition for admission.  If you are accepted as a non-degree-seeking graduate student:    You won't be treated in any way like an ordinary graduate student.  To the extent anyone in the department is aware of you, you'll be in a special category of ""person who wasn't admitted to the graduate program but is paying a lot of money to take courses anyway"", which is not a flattering description.  In particular, you should not expect faculty to supervise your research or interact with you any more or differently than they treat the undergraduates in these classes.  (It could happen, but I'd guess it probably won't.)  It won't help with admission, compared with doing equally well in similar courses elsewhere.  Specifically, any admissions committee will have members who want to make sure this isn't used as an easier back door to admission, and they will be sure to enforce strict standards.      I can graduate this year (as a junior) and become a ""qualifying student"", or become a ""visiting student"" and I can graduate a year later.    Are you sure you're interpreting these programs right?  In this listing of the categories, visiting students are enrolled in graduate programs elsewhere, while qualifying students are non-degree-seeking students who are trying to make up for weak backgrounds in the hope of future admission.  I'm not aware of any option for undergraduates to spend a year at Princeton, except for some international exchange programs.  However, I might well be missing some possibility.  ",2

"Microsoft [SEP] Google [SEP] Chinese IME: Microsoft or Google? [SEP] April 2016 update:  QQ IME is merged with Sogou, so now they use the same engine. The input quality of Sogou IMO is still second to none, but after these years, Sogou has got even more bloat.   Google Pinyin hasn't been updated since 2014. It is virtually dead.   The Windows 10 stock IME, Microsoft Pinyin, is probably a good bet, it is quite lean even compared with its predecessors, plus you don't have to install anything.   Some people vouch on 中州韵. It's an Open Source solution. Besides pinyin, it also supports a world of input solutions. I've tried it some time ago and it may have some quirks, but you get a totally free IME - How cool is that!  Below are the old answer. Some of it no longer holds but oh well.  --  Never ever use the default Windows IMEs for inputting Simplified Chinese text, they totally suck.  Sogou Pinyin is the father of all modern Chinese IMEs. It has the largest market share in China. It has a hell of a feature set, but current versions included lots of useless bells and whistles (Who the heck needs a custom theme for an IME?), of course you can disable them, but you have to dig into the settings menus.  Google Pinyin is an excellent IME. It copied many ideas from Sogou, even stealed the word and phrase database for once, but it has been improved for quite a bit. Due to the awkwardness of Google's position in China, it doesn't have much market share here, except for some die-hard google fans.   QQ Pinyin is another one on the rise. It is the last one joined into the competition, and I'd say it copied many ideas from Sogou as well, but its market share is drastically increasing due to the popularity QQ (the IM) in China.   The features of the 3 IMEs are quite similar. You wouldn't have problems switching from one to another, by far I still like Sogou most.  If you want a solution from Microsoft, try MSPY 2010. It originally came out with the release of Office 2010, and now you can get it as a separate download. It's not as cool as the other three. The only advantage you get is the hit rate of long sentence input. As saf123 mentioned, it's probably the only IME which doesn't gather user information.  And finally, the google trend chart:    The blue one is Sogou, of course.  All of the above IMEs support the input of Traditional Chinese texts, but since they all use GBK charset, if you are accustomed to the Big5 charset, i.e., you are from Hong Kong or Taiwan, some of the characters might come out a bit strange to you.

"tell a story [SEP] important first [SEP] Which is the better scheme for a poster: “tell a story” or “important first”? [SEP] Posters are hard to get right. They require design skills and knowing what the core message of your paper is. Presenting them requires people skills. Aside from this, different areas seem to have different criteria and norms when it comes to this so if you want to fit in you should try to follow those.    But in general, most scientific posters I've seen are really terrible in terms of tools for communication: they have far too much text and get into far too much technical detail. For example, on this site posted in the comments on the question, there's some nice visuals but all of the posters have, in my opinion, far too much text.   One excuse for a lot of text on a poster I often hear is that people will can read them on their own between sessions or whatever. In my own area and experience, I don't buy this argument: that's what the paper is for and I rarely see anyone reading these literal walls of text in their spare time.  The advice you've gotten from the internet seems to follow that thinking: the thinking of printing a full paper on a poster in bullet form. An A0/A1 wall of text is not the best way to sell your work, nor is a boring traditional narrative of introduction, methodology, results, related work, conclusion or whatever.  I say this from the perspective of someone who's gone to too many poster sessions and gotten trapped at a poster where someone for some reason decided I would be interested in spending 20 minutes silently listening to them recite the slightly abridged version of the paper that they had for some reason decided to printed on their poster. One guy even seemed to expect me to leave after he was done. After he had finished reading the conclusions at me he had a look on his face that said ""who's next?"".  Okay so that's one extreme.    For me, the secret to a good poster presentation is two-fold: the poster and the person in front of it.  In terms of a poster session, people will probably have some food with them, people might even have some drinks, you should not assume to take more than 5 minutes of their time, they're probably not going to get all the technical details and they're definitely not going to read a wall of text. At least one would hope that they wouldn't read it because that would imply that you'd be talking to yourself since they cannot read text and listen to you at the same time (unless you're reading aloud the text that is).  When I was working with students on posters, I would always advise them to dispose of the idea that they can or should communicate the full technical depth of a work on a poster to a passer-by in five minutes.  Their goal should be to motivate and communicate enough of the core ideas of the work to convince people passing by their poster that the paper would be worth taking the time to read and to teach them something cool.  In terms of that goal, I would bring the student to a white-board and tell them to pretend I was a conference-goer who knew nothing of the work but we met at a coffee break and I asked them to tell me about the work. They can use the board or ... if really needed ... they can point to something in the paper. While presenting, they should appear enthusiastic (without overselling) and emphasise why the work is important ... why I should care, and what the main results were.   They should also listen to what I say ... it should be a conversation. They should make sure that the person they're talking to is following them ... that they don't just launch into a 10 minute soliloquy at the first person that looks in their direction but that there's an element of interaction.  After that exercise whatever they were trying to represent on the board or whatever they needed to point at in the paper: that and pretty much only that is what goes on the poster ... diagrams, examples, main results ... things they can point to help them explain verbally what the work is about.  Then we'd sketch out a poster and try make it visually appealing ... try to tell a visual story with it ... try to make it attractive for people to come over and ask what it's about.  Not that the end result is always perfect, but the approach does lead to a better result in terms of a communication tool than the wall-of-text approach that seems so bizarre to me in the world of scientific posters.

"more often but less time [SEP] once in a few days but for a few hours [SEP] Guitar practice: more often but less time or once in a few days but for a few hours? [SEP]   What's better: pick up a guitar every day for a few minutes or play more rarely, but having a longer session?    Neither. It's not length of time, but what you do with it when you have it. If you spend your time playing the same three songs over and over again, you'll not likely improve save to be able to play three songs endlessly. That's a simplification, but it serves to illustrate a point.  If you're not spending your time working on things that you have trouble with, or working with tools and methods that help you improve, whether you do it for 10 minutes or 10 hours doesn't really matter.  Lets say you have an hour to dedicate to practicing (as opposed to just playing) your instrument, here is how I would suggest you break it down:    5m - warm up, stretching exercises  10m - modes, scale runs (try to work in things like string skipping)  15m - chords, inversions, arpeggios  15m - sight reading (I'll pick a new chart from the Real Book)  10m - general wanking  5m - musical meditation (listen to something new, play blindfolded...something to connect the soul to the music)    Always with a metronome all of it.  The combination of continually stretching your knowledge and your technique and the use of devices like a metronome to ensure you're performing consistently and measuring your success so you can push your limits on the next practice session are what yield results fast.

"XML [SEP] custom syntax [SEP] Python template engines: What are the real benifits and drawbacks to XML vs custom syntax [SEP] I think the consideration should probably be about how the templates are going to be written. The point of templates is to make sure that people are no longer hand coding (html, LaTeX, xml, whatever). This is why templating engines allow inheritance and other fancy features.  So, Daniel Roseman has a good point when he says that getting humans to write XML is evil. To some extent, you're using templates so you don't have to do that.   With that in mind, the largest difference I've seen between python templating engines is not, in fact, whether they use XML or some custom syntax. The large difference seems to be whether or not the templating engines allow arbitrary python code to be embedded into the template.  You mentioned both Cheetah and Jinja2. Both have special syntax but Cheeta allows pretty much arbitrary python to be embeded in the template, while Jinja2 places heavy restrictions on what can be done with the template. Now you're looking at a trade off between potentially mixing business and presentation logic, with making your template clear and concise.  In the end, the benefits are going to come from how easy it is to read, write, re-read, and  re-write your code.  ",1

"drinking alcohol [SEP] pills [SEP] For fear of flying is drinking alcohol a healthier option than pills? [SEP] If you have no specific medical condition that would be exacerbated by anti-anxiety drugs, I'd say you should at least try them to see if they work well for you. Most of them don't have serious side effects if you don't take too many, or too often.  Excessive drinking has well-documented negative effects, among them the possibility of violent behaviour that can get you into really bad trouble (as in: gigantic fines/damages, or even jail time) on a plane.

"air [SEP] train [SEP] Market economy: Why air is cheaper than train? [SEP] Your question has more is place on stack exchange economy when it will exist.  (And it starts with armchair physics.)  Still an interesting question.  I already asked myself this question, here are some thoughts:    Travel time is employee's time who need to be paid  The plane Berlin - Genova takes 1 h 45, the train 10 h.  During the flight, you are only taking 1 h 45 x the number of crew members.  During the train, you use 10 h x the number of crew members, maybe including night fees.  Infrastructure  Plus, for the train you need a big rail infrastructure that is expensive to build and to maintain.  For the plane you need air, which is still free. (Maybe you pay somewhere the persons who designed air routes.)  Junction fees  For the railway you need to pay train stations and junctions, for the plane you need to pay airport fees.  For the train if the way is inter-countries, you need to split the bill between two or more companies, for the plane it's only the air company.  Occupancy rate  The only international long distance train i took was almost empty, maybe if there were full there could be cheap tickets (and/or vice-versa).  All of the few planes i took were always pretty full.  ",2
"the Floyd Rose SpeedLoader tremolo system [SEP] have a second guitar on standby that's fully tuned [SEP] What are the benefits and drawbacks of the Floyd Rose SpeedLoader tremolo system? [SEP] A friend of mine had a guitar like this, and it wasn't too bad.  One of the main bummers was that finding strings for the thing was pretty tricky.  If you have to have special strings for the guitar, you have a lot less selection of strings and the different tones that different brands can provide, which is kind of a bummer.  On the plus side though, the guitar was still very playable, you could down tune it just fine (with some limitations, but reasonable limitations none the less), and re-stringing can be done pretty painlessly.  In my personal opinion, I think these guitars are kind of a waste, and more of a commodity item than anything else.  If you really need to have a string replaced that fast, just have a second guitar on standby that's fully tuned and ready to go.  ",3
"baking bread in a loaf pan [SEP] in a Dutch oven [SEP] What's the difference in baking bread in a loaf pan vs. in a Dutch oven? [SEP] There's two important distinctions:    The dutch oven is preheated, so the oven conveys a lot of heat, rather quickly.  This causes some steam to be pretty much immediately made.  The dutch oven is covered.  This traps the steam previously made.  This is trying to replicate steam injection and the goal of most methods that cover the loaf.    Steam keeps the crust from hardening and promotes better oven spring and crisper crust.  The steam basically allows the bread to 'swell' more in the oven.  Steam also gelatinizes the starches in the crust and formes a better 'shine' and 'crisp' on the finished product.  The dutch oven is then uncovered after awhile and the crust hardens.  ",3

"wooden woodwinds [SEP] plastic [SEP] Why do wooden woodwinds sound better than plastic? [SEP] The basic answer (which applies to carbon fiber stringed instruments too) is that our current understanding of materials science is insufficient to produce a material which exhibits as ""flat"", i.e. uniform frequency resonance curve as wood.  Keep in mind that it takes a lot of skill to select proper wood -- there's a reason reed instruments are made primarily of grenadilla and not any old tree from your backyard :-) .    Consider, OTOH, the fact that I've never even seen a wood mouthpiece.  There are many different styles and types of rubber/plastic ones, and some clarinetists swear by the crystal models (and saxophonists looking for giant sound use Otto Link metal mouthpieces).  Just pointing out that sometimes there are tradeoffs made in the interest of reliability as well as sound quality.  BTW, I used to play a metal clarinet in marching bands.  It sounded crappy but I suspect a properly designed and built model would sound fine, albeit more saxophonish.    For that matter, solid metal 'brass' instruments tend to sound better than their fiberglass brethren.  It's just a lot less painful to march with a lightweight Sousaphone, and the delta sound quality doesn't matter a whole lot in a football stadium.  ",2

"to target iOS 5 and ARC [SEP] an earlier version with MRC [SEP] Is it better to target iOS 5 and ARC or an earlier version with MRC? [SEP] Worrying about memory management  ARC is a godsend: it doesn't solve every problem, but it's much better than having to do it all yourself or the short detour into garbage collection with Mac OS X.   There are two things to keep in mind with it:    it's a compiler feature: Xcode provides ARC support for building to iOS 4 targets1.  It's optional, even targeting iOS 5. If you want to learn manual reference counting (MRC) just to make extra sure you know it, you can do it even targeting iOS 5.    But ARC doesn't take away the ability to understand how memory management works, it just removes the tedium of having to declare release and retain everywhere. Justin on Stack Overflow gave a good summary of the difference between ARC and manual reference counting (MRC):    If you don't want to learn MRC, then you may want to first try ARC. A lot of people struggle with, or try to ignore common practices of MRC (example: I've introduced a number of objc devs to the static analyzer). If you want to avoid those issues, ARC will allow you to postpone your understanding; you cannot write nontrivial objc programs without understanding reference counting and object lifetimes and relationships, whether MRC, ARC, or GC. ARC and GC simply remove the implementation from your sources and do the right thing in most cases. With ARC and GC, you will still need to give some guidance.    Beyond whether or not you should use ARC, you ought to consider support for the OS version: does it really make sense to focus on version-specific features (like zeroing weak references) when there aren't a whole lot of people using that version?   Or worse yet, if everyone's using iOS 3, how long do you have to wait until you can even start to use ARC?  This comes down to two things: device support and market share.  Device support  Thankfully, one of the benefits to developers with respect to iOS development is that the latest version of the software runs on older devices; generally going back at least 2 years.   So if you want to target iOS 5, you'll be able to target the following devices:    iPhone 4S (released October 2011)  iPad 2 (released March 2011)  iPod touch (4th generation, released September 2009)  iPhone 4 (released June 2010)  iPad (released April 2010)  iPod touch (3rd generation, released September 2009)  iPhone 3G S (released June 2009)    Which is a large set of options. If you target iOS 4.2, you can hit every device since iPhone 3G was released back in June 2008.  Market share  Which comes to the other question: should one spend time learning anything other than iOS 5 SDK: it depends on what you want to do.   If you want to just focus on the latest and greatest, use all the neat features available in the latest SDK, and damn market share (for now): by all means go for it.  If you want to maximize market share now, I'd hold off for a few more months.   Marco Arment, the creator of Instapaper (a really popular iOS app), publishes his usage stats from time to time and just released the latest report a few days ago. In it, he notes that iOS 5 has a 45.1/48% iPad/iPhone market share, while iOS 4.2 (needed for CDMA iPhone 4s that haven't upgraded to iOS 5 yet) has a 97/97.2% market share.  Generally, hitting 97% of the potential market is ""close enough"": I've seen it as a rule of thumb not just for iOS development, but for web development as well.  But one thing to consider is how long of a development cycle you're going to have. If you're not planning on launching for a few months, iOS 5 is not a bad choice, even if you're trying to hit a large portion of the potential market share.   iOS users tend to upgrade much quicker than on other platforms, for a variety of reasons, and there's no reason to believe the upgrade from iOS 4.x to iOS 5 will trend any differently. If you take iOS 4.2's market share as a baseline, it was only released a year ago. It's not unreasonable to assume that October of next year iOS 5 will be well into the 90% range.  Conclusion  Don't worry about memory management too much: ARC is a great convenience, but it's not a huge paradigm shift from earlier versions. Instead, worry about the other features and support issues. If you're launching today and need to hit the largest market share possible, target iOS 4 and consider using MRC. Otherwise, target iOS 5 and consider using ARC.  1caveat: you lose out on some features if you need to target < iOS 5, like zeroing weak references. If you want to go whole-hog into ARC, you're probably better off targeting iOS 5.  ",2

"MonoTouch [SEP] Objective-C [SEP] MonoTouch vs Objective-C for iPhone/iPod/iPad development [SEP] MonoTouch is a fantastic alternative. I've been using it for pretty much one year now, and I can't ever imagine going back to objective-c. Highlights: LINQ, LINQ to XML, LINQ, C#, LINQ, Garbage collector, LINQ, MonoTouch.Dialog, and a lot of other things.  Seriously, though.. nowadays most apps are always downloading data from the web, and you'll need to be converting that to objects, keeping them in lists, sorting and filtering them, and pushing them to databases. That stuff is so simple to do with C# and LINQ that I can't imagine people doing that in other languages.   The $400 dollar cost is not low, but you can probably make that money back in 1 month or so with no advertisement. And the amount of time MT will save you will offset that easily. Also remember, you don't have to pay until the app is ready for testing in a device, so its free for learning.  With that said, yes, its still totally worthy to learn Objective-C. It'll make you a better developer for the platform, you'll understand why some things are the way they are, and so on. You'll also be able to read Obj-C examples in the web and translate them to C#.   Finally, here's my suggestion: if you're thinking of getting in iOS development, go to MonoTouch. Spend a few weeks using it, and then make the decision of jumping to Obj-C. The hardest part of going to iOS development is not the Obj-C language, is all the new frameworks you'll have to learn. Being able to learn them in C# is a HUGE deal, you'll be a lot more productive from the start up. Just after you know those things look into Obj-C: everything will be already familiar, so it'll be easy to understand everything.  ",2
"Lotus Symphony [SEP] OpenOffice.Org [SEP] What are the differences between Lotus Symphony and OpenOffice.Org? [SEP] The most important difference between Lotus Symphony and OpenOffice that really matters, would be the fact that Symphony is, while based on OpenOffice code, still closed-source, whereas OO is entirely open source.  Engine-wise, it should not differ too much from OO since Symphony is a derivative fork from the OO project under IBM's heading. For now, underpinnings should still be the same, however it is not too impossible to expect that Symphony will start having major internal differences as time goes by, and IBM starts deviating Symphony from OO more in order to suit their own objectives better.  You would be right in saying that for now, the main differences between Symphony and OO would be the IBM branding and different interface. However, the interface is NOT just slightly different, and actually constitutes major differences in how you work in the office suite. Two chief differences are :    Tabbed interface in Symphony  Sidebar for quick options access in Symphony  Different toolbar layouts in Symphony      Symphony    OpenOffice  That said, the underlying engines are pretty similar, however Lotus Symphony might provide better integration with IBM products in the future.

"power heads [SEP] fashioned ""weed eater"" [SEP] Taming the jungle, power heads vs old fashioned ""weed eater"" [SEP] You have several options.     Gas trimmer (no power head option). These can be a bit cheaper than a power head option, but have less versatility, you can't convert them to a brush cutter, limb trimmer or rototiller. They might also have more durability as they don't have to worry about the connection between the power head and the attachment. There aren't a lot of these available anymore, most of them are power heads with string trimmers attached by default.  Gas Power head with string trimmer. If you need a trimmer anyways this might be the way to go here. You can start with heavy duty line, and if you need more power you can pick up the optional brush cutter attachment that gives you even more cutting ability. I went this route and recently bought the rototiller attachment and while it's not like having a real rototiller, it's reasonably effective for the investment.  Something heavier like the DR Trimmer - If you're going to have to go through this dance every year, you might want to invest in a push string trimmer with optional blade attachments. DR Trimmers makes one that looks really nice.    Personally unless you're expecting to do this kind of massive cleanup every single year, I'd go with the string trimmer and get the brush cutter attachment, it's going to be cheaper (you can do that for ~200$ if you go curved shaft on the trimmer) and it will likely meet you needs, although it will be a lot of work upfront. However, if you're not planning on maintaining your backyard and letting it overgrow again than putting down the cash and getting a walk behind string trimmer is the way to go.  ",1

"you choose your committee members [SEP] your advisor [SEP] Should you choose your committee members or should your advisor? [SEP] There are many ways to build PhD committee, which depend on the local system (country, etc.) and your field. But, here are some general principles that should apply broadly. You need to bring a mix of highly competent yet diverse evaluators, with not too much proximity to yourself or your advisor lest it be thought that you are cherry-picking a partial (friendly) jury for your work.  Regarding your questions:      Is it more important that your advisor already know your committee members or that you do    I don't think it's a very important part of the decision-making. Certainly, you don't want the advisor's best friend (or yours!), that could make people think you're scared of unbiased questioning.    Is it better to get someone in your discipline or someone doing more related work    Here's one of the factors that play a very important part, for me, in picking committee members. First, all members need to be able to have a good understanding of your work. However, it is good that not all of them are precisely expert in particular field of expertise. It helps to have people from other (related) fields, because they will bring a different perspective, and give you the opportunity to highlight not only the very technical details of your work but also its significance for other fields.    is the dissertation process supposed to be a chance for you to win people over to your side?    No. It's good to bring people who don't necessarily agree with you on everything, but you should also avoid as committee members anyone overly critical of your approach of things, unless you know them well and they can keep it under control and agree to disagree. Otherwise, you risk that person actually coming to your defense to win you over. I have seen defenses being “derailed” (though all ended well) by a committee member who was overly argumentative, and it wasn't a nice experience for anybody involved.    ",1
"Doing it in a good faculty with strong supervisor [SEP] weaker supervisor but more interesting project [SEP] PhD programme dilemma: Doing it in a good faculty with strong supervisor or weaker supervisor but more interesting project? [SEP] Based on what you've said I like option A. But of course you know more about this situation than can be conveyed in a post, and there is more information you can find out, to help make the right decision. For context, I am a math PhD student just about to graduate.  Some points for option A:    In my opinion, the most important thing in pursuing a PhD is to be  passionate about the work. I have known people who went about it  differently, picking a topic that they thought would gain them a  reputation so they could later do something interesting, but most of  the time these people end up either not graduating, or taking a very  very long time to graduate, or settling for a mediocre thesis just  to get it over with (which makes it hard to find a job). What you  are about to do is extremely challenging, and you need that personal  drive to get through it.  Now, you can pursue something you are passionate about with both A and B. But the fact that you already know a project that gets you  excited with A outweighs that the supervisor at B has a better  reputation. Especially since the adviser at A is young, maybe s/he  just does not have a good reputation yet. Someone interested in  what you are interested in is valuable, and more rare than you may  expect, and a collaboration can bring good things for both of you.  When someone has a good reputation in academia, it  usually is not a result of their skills as a mentor, or in finding  jobs for their students, or in helping students find their place in  the community. A professor might be good at those things, but it is  not required for them to be known as a great scientist or  mathematician. Nonetheless a professor with such a reputation is  going to attract a lot of students, often for the wrong reasons, and  they must compete for his/her attention, also often for the wrong  reasons. You don't want to join a fleet of satellites.  Schools that are concerned about their reputations are less likely to encourage exploration of unconventional topics.    Everything I've said though is coming from my more categorical impressions. You have the ability to get more information, and maybe what I've said does not even apply. So my main advice is to get more info until you are confident about a choice. One of the best ways to do that is to visit each school over a weekend and, in particular, buy some of the supervisors' students a few drinks.  ",3

"the string [SEP] the body [SEP] Which one has more impact on the sound, the string or the body? [SEP] On an electric guitar, the construction of the body is of limited importance. At the high end of the market, people worry about the tonal qualities of various kinds of wood, but for the most part, we worry about an electric guitar body being as rigid as possible, and the pickups are where most of the character comes from.  On an acoustic guitar, the construction of the guitar itself has the most impact on its sound. You are hearing the vibration of the sound board, so what's important is the frequencies that are absorbed or reinforced by the way the body vibrates, and the way the bridge transmits vibration from the string to the body.  You can put great strings on a bad acoustic guitar, and it will still sound bad.  How do you know a guitar is good quality? Use your ears. If you can't hear the difference, the difference isn't important!  However, one rule of thumb is that plywood is the mark of a cheap guitar. You can recognise plywood by looking at the sound hole -- you can see the layers. You get a significant step up in tone from a solid wood sound board.   ",1

"LL [SEP] LR [SEP] What are the main advantages and disadvantages of LL and LR parsing? [SEP] I'll contrast LL and LR parsing for a number of criteria:  Complexity  LL wins here, hands down. You can easily hand-write an LL parser. In fact, this is commonly done: the Microsoft C# compiler is a hand-written recursive descent parser (source here, look for a comment made by Patrick Kristiansen - the blog post is very interesting as well).  LR parsing uses a rather counter-intuitive method to parse a text. It works, but it took me some time to wrap my head around how it works exactly. Writing such a parser by hand is therefore hard: you'd be more or less implementing an LR parser-generator.  Generality  LR wins here: all LL languages are LR languages, but there are more LR languages than LL languages (a language is an LL language if it can be parsed with an LL parser, and a language is an LR language if it can be parsed with an LR parser).  LL has quite a few nuisances that will bother you when implementing just about any programming language. See here for an overview.  There are unambiguous languages that are not LR languages, but those are pretty rare. You almost never encounter such languages. However, LALR does have a few issues.  LALR is more or less a hack for LR parsers to make the tables smaller. The tables for an LR parser can typically grow enormous. LALR parsers give up the ability to parse all LR languages in exchange for smaller tables. Most LR parsers actually use LALR (not secretively though, you can usually find exactly what it implements).  LALR can complain about shift-reduce and reduce-reduce conflicts. This is caused by the table hack: it 'folds' similar entries together, which works because most entries are empty, but when they are not empty it generates a conflict. These kinds of errors are not natural, hard to understand and the fixes are usually fairly weird.  Compiler errors and error recovery  LL wins here. In an LL parse, it's usually pretty easy to emit useful compiler errors, in particular in hand-written parsers. You know what you're expecting next, so if it doesn't turn up, you usually know what went wrong and what the most sensible error would be.  Also, in LL parsing, error recovery is a lot easier. If an input doesn't parse correctly, you can try to skip ahead a bit and figure out if the rest of the input does parse correctly. If for instance some programming statement is malformed, you can skip ahead and parse the next statement, so you can catch more than one error.  Using an LR parser this is a lot more difficult. You can try to augment your grammar so that it accepts erroneous input and prints errors in the areas where things went wrong, but this is usually pretty hard to do. The chance you end up with a non-LR (or non-LALR) grammar also goes up.  Speed  Speed is not really an issue with the manner in which you parse your input (LL or LR), but rather the quality of the resulting code and the use of tables (you can use tables for both LL and LR). LL and LR are therefore comparable in this respect.  Links  Here is a link to a site also contrasting LL and LR. Look for the section near the bottom.  Here you can find a conversation regarding the differences. It's not a bad idea to critically look at the opinions voiced there though, there is a bit of a holy war going on there.  For more info, here and here are two of my own posts about parsers, though they are not strictly about the contrast between LL and LR.  ",1

"Normal LonelyPlanet guides [SEP] the new Discover series [SEP] Normal LonelyPlanet guides vs. the new Discover series [SEP] I haven't purchased any of the new ""Discover"" series. The fact that the website describes the ""New Series"" as having ""the highlights"" and ""The Original"" as ""the definitive guide,"" I suspect that they cut out a lot of information to make the Discover series more compact and have more room for photos.    That being said, if you want photos and something that gives you a high-level snapshot of a particular place, the Discover series could be useful. (You can also take a short quiz where Lonely Planet will try to guess which series is better for you - you click the ""Find Out"" button, provide your name and email, take the quiz, and get a 20% discount code.)  It's worth noting that if you buy a Discover guide and find it's lacking some information you really wanted or needed, you can purchase individual chapter PDFs of the guidebooks from Lonely Planet's online store. They charge $4.95 (USD) per chapter; a little pricey in my opinion, but way better than buying a whole new book if you're lacking a particular bit of information.  ",1

"worm castings [SEP] worm casting tea [SEP] Which is preferred: worm castings or worm casting tea? [SEP] If you're talking about leachate (worm castings steeped in water), some gardeners say that this tea will have approximately the same benefit to plant growth as the pure composted worm castings themselves.   But studies have shown that, in the long run, using the castings directly in the soil will produce better plant growth, often far better, than does leachate obtained by steeping the castings in water. Some of those studies were carried out by Ohio State University, Mississippi State University, Colorado State University, Cornell and others. (citation needed)  But if your main objective is speed of results, then the teas solution will find their way into the plant’s system more quickly than waiting for the dried casting to be ""watered in"" over time. Castings tea can also be used as a foliar spray/wash for even faster results.  But ""tea"" production methods vary — so consider, if your tea is ""aerobically brewed"", you're also increasing the diversity of beneficial microbes and adding to the soil the environment needed to keep the beneficial organisms alive and multiplying in your soil; more so than can be typically obtained from the castings themselves.  The best solution to this argument is to do both — to receive the full benefits of worm casting, apply it directly to the soil as both as an admendment and an occasional top dressing around the base of the plants. Then give them a good drink of tea however often as you see fit — weekly would be ideal, depending on your supply — neither the tea nor the castings will burn your plants.   ",1

"a nonstop flight [SEP] multiple connections [SEP] Why is a nonstop flight sometimes more expensive than multiple connections? [SEP] I think the answer has to do with competition.  If you want to fly from Madrid to Rio de Janeiro with one stop, you have lots of options.  You can fly TAM (via Sao Paulo), TAP Portugal (via Lisbon), American (via New York or Miami), KLM (via Amsterdam), Air France (via Paris), etc, etc.  (I found these with Kayak.)  There is a lot of competition and this will tend to drive fares down.  However, if you want to fly from Madrid to Sao Paulo nonstop, your only choices are TAM, Iberia, and (somewhat surprisingly) Air China (though only twice a week).  There is less competition, so fares may tend to be higher, and this may exceed the effect of the cost of the extra flight GRU-GIG.  As a more exaggerated example, from my home airport of Ithaca (ITH), I've often seen ITH-EWR-SFO (a total of 4400 km) priced lower than ITH-EWR (which is only 275 km).  There are three different airlines providing one-stop service ITH-xxx-SFO, but only one that flies ITH-EWR nonstop.  This effect is why hidden city ticketing can sometimes be advantageous, and why airline policies usually forbid it.  ",3

"caramelized onions [SEP] crispy onions [SEP] What is the difference between caramelized onions and ""crispy onions""? [SEP] Both crispy and caramelized onions are cooked for a long time, and will be very brown.  However, they are cooked slightly differently.  Caramelized onions are usually cross-cut on the onion to release its moisture, and then cooked over very low heat in a crowded pan, stirring infrequently, so that they gradually release their sugars and liquid and it turns to caramel.  Depending on the onions and desired result, you may even cover them, an add a little liquid and/or sugar.  The end result is very soft and very sweet.  Arabic-style crispy onions are cut pole-to-pole in order to avoid rupturing cells in the onions.  They are then fried over medium heat in an uncrowded pan, stirring regularly.  This lets them dry out and become brown and crispy, even burning on thin ends.  These onions should be a mix of crispy and chewy, and more savory than sweet.   ",1

"High GPA [SEP] industry R&D project experience [SEP] Which is more important to get into top CS PhD program: High GPA or industry R&D project experience? [SEP] Neither.  Top CS PhD progams are looking for strong evidence of future potential as an independent researcher.  Everything else is secondary. Recommendation letters that speak directly to your research potential, in personal, technical, and credible detail, with direct comparisons with other students they have mentored who have gone on to strong PhD programs, will serve you far better than either a perfect GPA or industry internships or even both.  Strong research results are even better.  A better way to way to ask this question is...    Which is more important for finding a strong, supportive mentor and a fruitful topic for undergraduate research: high GPA or industry internships?    But even this is missing the mark. It's not your GPA that you want to maximize, but rather (1) your mastery of the material, and (2) your interactions with faculty.  A recommendation letter that says nothing but ""My class was hard; Oshan got an A."" is utterly useless. (We call them DWIC letters, for ""Did Well In Class"".)  Similarly, industry interships are only useful if they provide you with opportunities for intellectual creativity, or leverage for getting into a specific research project that you care about.  In particular, unless you actually care enough about image processing to want to do research on it, an internship doing image processing is just spinning your wheels.  The most important advice I can give is to talk to your potential research mentors as soon as possible. Ask them what they look for in potential undergraduate researchers. (They might say ""a high GPA"" or ""industry internships"", and then you have your answer.)  Ask them about their track record in placing students in top PhD programs.  Ask them what they would expect you to justify a strong recommendation letter. Ask them what sort of research they do, and how to get involved.  If they don't have time to work with you ask for pointers to interesting papers to read, problems to think about, projects to work on on your own.  Do not wait for permission; just start knocking on doors. Today.  ",1
"""Wallpaper*"" guidebooks [SEP] others [SEP] What's the difference in content and focus between ""Wallpaper*"" guidebooks and others? [SEP] Wallpaper travel guides are an offshoot of Wallpaper* Magazine, the self-proclaimed ""world's number one global design destination, championing the best in architecture, interiors, fashion, art and contemporary lifestyle.""  Or, if you haven't drunk enough of the Tyler Brûlé Kool-Aid to suppress your gag reflex when hearing the words ""contemporary lifestyle"", it's a magazine catering squarely to pretentious yuppies who want to read articles and see pretty pictures about obscenely expensive things they're unlikely to ever buy, and invariably glowing reviews of insufferably hip and obscure shops, restaurants and bars they're unlikely to ever visit.  Compile enough of these articles about a single place together and, ta-dah, you've got a Wallpaper travel guide.  So the bulk of the content is, IMHO, ""dumbed-down directories of overpriced shopping and dining for posers""; see the website's travel section for a sampling.  I'm particularly impressed by their list of ""10 travel essentials"", and will definitely take a brass-studded Petit Dejeuner trunk along next time I hitchhike.  But hey, if you just can't make up your mind about which hotel in Paris to blow €695/night on and ""bespoke Lasvit chandeliers made up of 800 individual hand-blown crystal leaves"" happen to be your thing, maybe Wallpaper is what you're looking for.  (And FWIW, I've actually got some respect for Tyler, his current mag Monocle has interesting stuff every now and then.  But he left Wallpaper in 2002 and its current owner, Time-Warner, has been milking the cash cow for every cent they can get ever since.)  ",3

"Rock-n-roll [SEP] Rhythm-n-Blues [SEP] What distinguishes Rock-n-roll from Rhythm-n-Blues? [SEP]   Can one make an objective, quantifiable distinction between    Rock-n-roll and Rhythm-n-Blues?    Short answer: No.  Long Answer:  Alan Freed's use of the term rock-n-roll in the 1950s is often considered definitive. He used the term to refer to R&B combos, black vocal groups, saxophonists, black blues singers, and white artists playing in the authentic R&B style.  Rhythm-n-Blues was early Rock-n-roll.  Early rock-n-roll was the popular, and commercial (and often ""white"") face of Rhythm-n-Blues.    First, try to define rock and roll. I thought it was that driving back beat, until I heard an Egyptian band that could give Bo Diddley lessons. - Harry Hepcat    Whilst Wikipedia says...    ""The Fat Man"" is a rhythm and blues song co-written by Fats Domino and Dave Bartholomew and recorded by Fats Domino. It is considered to be one of the first rock and roll records.    Once you get towards the end of the 1950s however both terms have started to evolve along interweaving paths into RnB and the all encompassing umbrella term of Rock music.  ",0

"""I"" [SEP] ""II"" [SEP] What is the difference between a ""I"" or ""II"" after a job title? [SEP] In a job title, ""I"" or ""II"" usually denotes the level of experience.  You will also see ""assistant"", ""senior"" and similar adjectives used.  The idea is that employees can be hired at one of several levels of experience and that employees can advance through these levels as they gain experience.    Someone hired as a ""Analyst I"" may be promoted to a ""Analyst II"" after some number of years.  Sometimes these kinds of job titles also have additional educational requirements (such as an advanced degree or certification) for the higher levels.  Typically there are different pay ranges that apply to employees as they advance through the classifications.    The definitions of the different levels will vary from one employer to another so there's really nothing more specific that we can say in answer to this question- you'll have to check the definitions used by your employer to see what the requirements are for each level.

"Self-drive [SEP] guided safari [SEP] Self-drive vs. guided safari in Southern Africa [SEP] I can show you my experience in guided and self-drive safaris. That's my experience and it could be different depending on the parks, the weather and other conditions. My experience is limited to Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania, which are on the East side of Africa, and Senegal, which is at the north; and there are not too many game parks. I have in mind a travel to Namibia-Botswana; according my research (asking people that have made safaris in east Africa and south Africa), all African parks are similar, except Kenyan ones (which are very crowded).  Ok, after this preamble, this is my experience:  When you buy a guided tour you have 3 options:    Buy an exclusive safari package in a big 4x4 car (very expensive option)  Buy a ""normal"" safari package (may be in a 4x4 or in a safari van)  Buy a budget safari package (sharing a safari van with more people)    In these videos you can see what a ""safari van"" is like inside and outside (sorry, the video is in Spanish). As you can imagine, it is not the most comfortable option.    If you are thinking of an ""exclusive safari,"" I think this is a great option, but if you don't want to waste a lot of money, or if you would like to feel the (partial) adventure of driving surrounded by game, I recommend you rent a small 4x4. It is better than a safari package. Why?    Drivers have to rest, you do not. As you know, drivers are workers and they have a timetable. They are working, not relaxing. Also, they have gone hundreds of times to the park, have seen thousands elephants, and are not as excited as you when they see a leopard. This means they probably won't make the most of the day as you will do.  Drivers tend to protect the car. In Africa a car is a luxury, and it is very expensive to repair, so drivers rarely try to do things like cross a river or go up a hill. If the driver owns a van, that likelihood of avoiding rough terrain is increased.  Drivers tend to save fuel. There is a speed limit in the parks of about 30-40 kilometers per hour, theoretically. Hired drivers typically won't go more than about 20 km/h; self-drivers usually go 50 km/h. This is because you pay in advance, so they will try to get you to see all animals, but in a limited part of the parks. If you pay an extra fee, a driver won't have any problem to take you where you want.  Driving is fun! And driving in Africa is double-fun! And don't worry about getting stranded; you are in a touristy area. Sooner or later somebody will come to help you. We always could use our mobile phones, and we had really difficulties staying alone for more than 30 minutes anyway.    If you can read Spanish, I point you to some interesting articles in my blog (like this and this).  A common criticism against self-driving is that the driver-guides know where the animals are. That's not my experience. The animals are free to move, and the only advantage a driver has is their knowledge about the areas where animals ""normally"" are. For instance, you never expect to find a leopard in the middle of the savannah, but rather, in a tree. You can adquire this knowledge, believe me, in less than a week: animals are spectacular, but predictable. A common-sense rule that you have to follow (and car drivers do) is to go anywhere where you see a lot of cars stopped. Also, you can ask other drivers (self-drivers or not) about what they have found. Finding animals is not so difficult, except for some of the rare animals (rhinos) or those with uncommon behaviours (tree-climbing lions).  ",2

"Stroller [SEP] baby sling [SEP] Which is more convenient in Hong Kong ? Stroller or baby sling? [SEP] No contest: baby sling.  Wikivoyage has an article about travelling in Japan with children, and the bit about travelling in dense Japanese cities applies to Hong Kong as well:    In a nutshell, leave your giant stroller at home, as they can be a    nightmare to deal with. City sidewalks are busy, temple and shrine    paths are nearly invariably gravel, trains are crowded (impossibly so    in rush hour), and while elevators are slowly being retrofitted    everywhere, there are still many stations where you'll need to use the    stairs or take long detours to use the one elevator available. [...]  Instead, the Japanese prefer baby carriers, often for children as old    as two, and lightweight collapsible umbrella strollers that fit    through normal ticket gates and can be carried up or down a flight of    stairs one-handed in a pinch.    In my own experience, umbrella strollers are handy, but require two adults to comfortably operate: eg. one climbs up stairs with baby, the other carries stroller, diaper bag, suitcase, etc.  A 6-month-old is also a bit borderline to use one for longer periods of time, try it out before you take one along.  And yes, September will be hot.  If you're feeling uncomfortably hot, the baby will be feeling so as well.  Fortunately virtually everything in HK is air-conditioned.  ",3

Websites that provide scripts that run on the client machine (JavaScript being a common technology) allow for content to be processed and changed without the need for a server roundtrip. On the other hand, Server-side scripting (such as languages like PHP) are processed on the server, hence the need for a reload.

"MBA [SEP] Masters in a business subject [SEP] What is the difference between MBA and Masters in a business subject, and which is better for a future researcher? [SEP] An MBA is a professional degree designed for students who will go to work in industry and not pursue further graduate study or research.  Students in MBA programs typically all take the same courses in lock step with very few electives or options.  It generally isn't possible to specialize in a particular area in an MBA program.  In that sense, an MBA program is very much like medical school or law school and totally unlike graduate study in engineering and the arts and sciences.   Students in MBA programs usually have several years of full time experience working in low level corporate jobs after completing a bachelors degree.  Because they have had some exposure to the corporate/business world, the courses that they take draw on that experience.     In comparison, the Master's in Management is a professionally oriented degree program aimed primarily at students who have just completed a bachelor's degree.  These programs tend to be more theoretical simply because students have less practical experience to draw on.  Many business schools also offer professionally oriented masters degrees in more specialized technical areas (e.g. a Master's degree in mathematical finance or operations research or analytics.)    PhD programs in business schools are typically very separate from MBA programs and the students in the PhD program will typically take very few if any courses with the MBA students.  PhD students take more theoretical course work, take advanced courses in an area of specialization (e.g. accounting, finance, marketing, etc.) take course work in research methods, and then conduct research and write a dissertation.        If you're just completing a bachelor's degree and want to get a masters and go to work in industry, than a Masters in Management is the typical path.  If you're just completing a bachelor's degree and want to become a business school professor then a PhD program would be appropriate.  If you've had several years of experience in business and want to move up in management, then an MBA would be the typical path for you.    ",1

"onError handler [SEP] exceptions [SEP] Is onError handler better than exceptions? [SEP] I agree with Paul Equis's answer that exceptions should be preferred, but with a caveat.  One major feature of exceptions is that they break control flow.  This is usually desirable, but if it isn't then some other pattern might be useful for augmenting the exception system.  For example, suppose you're writing a compiler.  Exceptions might not be the best choice here, because throwing an exception stops the compile process.  This means that only that first error would be reported.  If you want to keep reading the source code in order to try and find more errors (as the C# and VB compilers do), then some other system is needed for reporting errors to the outside world.  The easiest way to take care of that would be saving the exceptions to a collection and then returning it. However, using an OnError delegate might be worthwhile if you want to give the caller an opportunity to give advice on how to proceed after each error.  That sounds like an uncommon scenario to me, though.  If you're not asking the caller to really micro-manage error handling, then using some flags to specify error-handling behavior would be less fiddly to work with.  ",3

"Haskell AND Lisp [SEP] Haskell OR Lisp [SEP] Haskell AND Lisp vs. Haskell OR Lisp [SEP] I suggest learning both, Haskell first, then Common Lisp. My experience with Haskell was that the static typing seemed to be a restricting annoyance at first, but once I got used to it, I noticed that most of my type errors had logic errors hiding behind them. When you get to this point, and the next milestone, which is learning to think in types and define your own types as a means of expressing your solution, you'll be ready for Common Lisp.   With Common Lisp, you can add monads, currying, and everything you liked from Haskell, but you also get multiple inheritance like Frank Shearar mentioned, and generic functions with multiple dispatch, and an advanced exception handling system.   So why not just learn Common Lisp first? Coming from a procedural and OOP background, my experience has been that I didn't really understand functional programming until I had to use it exclusively. Once functional programming is comfortable, you can add the rest of the tools that Common Lisp makes available, and use whatever tool is best at the task at hand.   ",2

"Apprenticeship [SEP] imitation learning [SEP] Apprenticeship vs. imitation learning - what is the difference? [SEP] In general, yes, they are the same thing, which means to learn from demonstration (LfD). But usually apprenticeship learning is mentioned in the context of ""Apprentiship learning via inverse reinforcement learning"" (IRL).  Both methods learn from demonstration, but they learn different things:    Imitation learning (a.k.a. behavioral cloning) will try to copy the teacher. This can be achieved by supervised learning alone. The AI will try to copy even irrelevant actions such as blinking or scratching, for instance, or even mistakes. You could use RL here too, but only if you have a reward function.  Apprentiship learning via inverse reinforcement learning will try to infer the goal of the teacher. In other words, it will learn a reward function from observation, which can then be used in reinforcement learning. If it discovers that the goal is to hit a nail with a hammer, it will ignore blinks and scratches from the teacher, as they are irrelevant to the goal.    ",2
"to buy the whole trip [SEP] leg by leg [SEP] It is cheaper to buy the whole trip or leg by leg? [SEP] It can certainly be less expensive to purchase separate tickets for certain segments as opposed to the complete journey, particularly on a mixed itinerary.  I would strongly advise against this unless you are a very experienced international traveler, for a number of reasons:    Checked baggage - Even if the two airlines you are flying have an interlining agreement, the agent may still refuse to check them through if the segments are on separate tickets. Thus, you would need to claim your baggage, get processed by customs and immigration, and then stand in line to have them re-checked to your next destination.  Flight irregularities - Since the two tickets are independent of one another, agents from the first airline will be unable to protect you on your connecting flight in the event of weather, mechanical problems, air traffic conditions, labor actions, or any of the other things that can cause your first flight to be delayed or canceled.  Indeed, airlines adjust their schedules constantly, and you may find that your first flight has been shifted three hours later, making the connection impossible; you would be responsible for contacting the second airline to make arrangements and to pay any associated change fees. This is of particular concern on international flights, where many routes have frequencies of once a day or even less.     If the flights are on the same record (PNR), you avoid the above scenarios, as the agent would have no reason to refuse interlining your bags, and in the event of problems with any segment that causes you to misconnect, the airline you purchased with would be responsible for booking you on alternative flights. Otherwise, in a worst case scenario, you could be forced to pay thousands of dollars for a walk-up fare to continue your journey. Given that, a few hundred dollars seems like cheap insurance.  I will say that these risks are not serious when booking your outbound and return trips on separate tickets, unless you have a very short turnaround time. It is not necessarily cheaper to do it this way, and you may lose some benefits. For example, a United Airlines round trip award ticket allows both a stopover and an open jaw, but not on two one-way awards, even though each requires the same number of miles.  ",2
"Trial/Free & Full Version [SEP] Free App + In-app billing [SEP] Trial/Free & Full Version VS. Free App + In-app billing? [SEP]   It's one code only in either case, you are just using either compile-time or run-time conditionals in it. Unfortunately Java lacks compile-time conditionals, so you have to be creative there (Java can optimize away if(static_final_variable), so you will just have two versions of one source defining that variable).  The chance that someone will crack your application is the same in either option and depends on the strength of the check that the user has valid license. Google provides interface to check license on the Market through the Market client, but it also depends on how tightly you integrate the checks in the application and therefore how hard you make it to disable them via disassembling.    The license can be obtained in two ways, either by purchasing the app on the market (separate APK) or by in-app billing (unlocking features). The later obviously involves some extra work, so that slightly favors the separate applications.  On the other hand you could do the billing in single package yourself and avoid giving 30% to Google, but that's a lot of work.    One package with unlocking features will be slightly more convenient for the user, because settings and content will be carried over. How much this favors single package depends on how much such content you expect average user to have.    ",1
"to use pre-existing bad practices [SEP] good practices that don't fit well with old code [SEP] Is it better to use pre-existing bad practices, or good practices that don't fit well with old code? [SEP] You should choose better design if:    You are going to be taking over a large part of future coding  Better design isn't more expensive to the client in the long run. For instance, I have witnessed multi-month ""refactorings"" for projects that were discontinued by the end of the year.    You should choose ""same bad style"" if:    You're just helping out. It's unrealistic to think you can take an existing group and will them to higher design standards if you're just a part-time fill-in on the project.  Better design is subjective and almost always has a learning curve. If that new design isn't learned by the rest of the team then the project will end up with a mish-mash of styles, and your better designed code may end up in the pile of stuff that nobody changes because they can't understand it. In your example above, what happens if there are updates to the third party software?  Sacrificing ""better"" design will get you a tangible business advantage. Like adding feature X badly will get you a large contract, but missing the deadline causes you to end up with nothing. This is where the historic conflict between mgmt and the technical team come in.

"Adaptive Control [SEP] Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning [SEP] What's the difference between Adaptive Control and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning? [SEP] The difference between the two tasks really comes down to the level of continuity assumed in the models of the problem.  In adaptive control, continuity is assumed at all levels; the problem space and the actions to be executed are all continuous.  In hierarchical reinforcement learning, although the problem space is continuous, the actions to execute upon the space are discrete.  A good analogy for this is the robot arm trying to move to a certain goal. Adaptive control would work with Jacobian to find a continuous solution to this problem. Reinforcement learning would select actions (up, down, left, right) to learn the problem space and find a solution.   Hierarchical reinforcement learning and adaptive control are really complements of each other. When the problem gets too complex to compute with Adaptive Control, hierarchical learning steps in to make it discrete and more scalable.  For another perspective, especially since my explanation breaks down when you consider continuous HRL (which does exist), consider this explanation from my personal correspondence with Daniel Rasumussan:    Practically, there are many differences between how they [Adaptive Control and HRL in a continuous space] are    implemented; they use different algorithms, different learning rules,    different representations, etc.  For example, adaptive control is not    typically hierarchical.  You could arguably call it a hierarchy with a    depth of 1 (with e.g. the ""high level"" being control in the x,y space    and ""low level"" being control in the motor space).  But there's no    temporal abstraction in that hierarchy; the high level isn't trying to    encapsulate low level decisions, the problem is how to find a nice    reliable one-to-one mapping between those two spaces.  Of course you    could make adaptive control hierarchical, as you can make pretty much    anything hierarchical, but that isn't typically what they're    interested in.  Perhaps a more critical difference is that in motor    control typically it is assumed that the transition and reward    functions are known to the agent.  There may be some unknown    variability in the case of adaptive control, but by and large the    agent has a pretty good idea what the effects of its actions will be,    and what the goal is that it is trying to achieve.  It's one of the    key principle of reinforcement learning that that information is not    known, and must be figured out by the agent by exploring the    environment.  Now again here, you could come up with a motor control    problem where the agent doesn't assume that information is known, but    that just isn't the kind of problem those techniques are designed for,    in general.  So, to sum up, there certainly is a gradient between HRL    and adaptive control, and by tweaking various assumptions you can    bring them closer together or farther apart.  But just implementing    continuous actions in HRL would still leave you quite a ways from    adaptive control.    As for an example combination this, one might imagine using hierarchical reinforcement learning to play a video game like Pong and then changing the physics of the game (Pong on slippery ice!) so that Adaptive Control might step in.

"coffee grinds/beans labeled as ""espresso coffee"" [SEP] ordinary coffee [SEP] What is the difference between coffee grinds/beans labeled as ""espresso coffee"" and ordinary coffee? [SEP] It IS the roast that is the difference.  The only real difference in the beans is that some beans taste better at a higher roast than others, so they are more appropriate for espresso.  Your Italian grocery coffee company may be using the espresso label for marketing purposes, but in general, espresso coffee beans can be the same beans that are used for ""regular"" coffee, but roasted to a French or Italian roast level, which is darker than City or Full City.  Since the advent of Starbucks, many roasts are much darker than they used to be.  Dunkin' Donuts coffee, which is a Full City roast, used to be the norm, but now a French seems to be what you can buy.    I roast my own coffee and take it to just into the second crack which is, generally, a Full City roast...a point where the character of the coffee predominates rather than the flavor of the roast.  There is more information about roasts at Sweet Marias where I buy my green beans, and reading through the site will give you way more of a coffee education than you probably ever wanted.   So, yes, you can use the coffee you have to make brewed coffee.  It will probably be roastier than you would normally have, unless it is just a marketing ploy, in which case it will taste normal.  Consider how long you have had this coffee; if it has been shelved for a while ""normal"" probably won't be all that great, since freshly roasted coffee is, generally, way better than old coffee.  But as long as the oils aren't rancid, it is more likely just going to be bland.  ",1

"SVN [SEP] Git [SEP] What does SVN do better than Git? [SEP] Subversion is a central repository  While many people will want to have distributed repositories for the obvious benefits of speed and multiple copies, there are situations where a central repository is more desirable. For example, if you've got some critical piece of code that you don't want anyone to access, you'd probably not want to put it under Git. Many corporations want to keep their code centralized, and (I guess) all (serious) government projects are under central repositories.  Subversion is conventional wisdom  This is to say that many people (especially managers and bosses) have the usual way to number the versions and seeing the development as a ""single line"" along time hardcoded into their brain. No offense, but Git's liberality is not easy to swallow. The first chapter of any Git book tells you to blank out all the conventional ideals from your mind and start anew.  Subversion does it one way, and nothing else  SVN is a version control system. It has one way to do its job and everybody does it the same way. Period. This makes it easy to transition to/from SVN from/to other centralized VCS. Git is NOT even a pure VCS -- it's a file-system, has many topologies for how to set up repositories in different situations -- and there isn't any standard. That makes it harder to choose one.  Other advantages are:    SVN supports empty directories  SVN has better Windows support  SVN can check out/clone a sub-tree  SVN supports exclusive access control svn lock which is useful for hard-to-merge files  SVN supports binary files and large files more easily (and doesn't require copying old versions everywhere).  Adding a commit involves considerably fewer steps since there isn't any pull/push and your local changes are always implicitly rebased on svn update.    ",2

"rain water [SEP] tap water [SEP] Is rain water better than tap water for plants? [SEP] Your tap water will have particular properties depending on where you live, the source of your water, and whether you have some sort of water softener or filtering system. My tap water, for example, is from the public system and is considered 'hard' because it has a high mineral (calcium and/or magnesium) content.  If I use tap water consistently on certain plants, I can see white rings of calcium deposits sitting on the soil surface; this can change the chemical properties - such as the pH - of the soil which can affect plant growth. Softened water has higher levels of salt than plants prefer, and these salts can build up in the soil. I've never seen the chlorine in public water causing any ill effects on my plants, but if you have sensitive house-plants you can let chlorine-treated water sit out for 24 hours to let the chlorine evaporate. As long as you live in an area that isn't subject to extremely acidic rain, rainwater is preferable because it's missing things like excessive minerals or disinfectant chemicals.    ",2

"funding or scholarship opportunity for business students [SEP] other background students [SEP] Why is there less funding or scholarship opportunity for business students compared to other background students? [SEP] It may be useful to take a slightly larger perspective, rather than comparing just business vs. STEM.  While there is a great degree of variation around the world and from program to program, most higher-level degree funding can be clustered into three general categories:    Doctoral degrees in STEM fields are generally funded by universities or external agencies.  Terminal ""professional"" degrees, including MBA, MD, JD, DDS, etc. frequently expect students to be responsible for their own funding, often going deeply into debt to do so.  Doctoral degrees in humanities and liberal arts fields are in-between, where sometimes students are supported or partially supported and other times they are not.    There's a great deal of variation, of course.  For example, I believe that the education of medical doctors is supported by some nations (though I lack a reference at the moment).  Likewise, Masters degrees are sometimes considered a ""professional degree"" that students are expected to fund, while other times they are lumped in with STEM doctoral degrees and funded by the university or other sources.  So, why should this be the case?  It seems to me that a lot of this is simply independently developing markets:    STEM students are typically expected to contribute significantly to the investigation of science and engineering as part of their training, and since these contributions can be very valuable in those markets, it makes sense for external funding agencies to include students in their funding.  Professional degrees are often coupled with very high post-graduation salaries, while the training period is much more one-way, with the students spending most of their time learning rather than making novel (and readily fundable) contributions.  Humanities and liberal arts are also quite important societally, but they are not currently associated with markets flush with capital and an easy set of incentives to pour money into schools either during the program (as with STEM) or afterward (as with professional degrees).  As such, they have generally developed much more ad hoc and patchwork approaches to funding degrees.    ",1

"a skillet [SEP] a saute pan [SEP] What's the functional different between a skillet and a saute pan? [SEP] Skillets are not designed to hold much liquid; as you point out, the curved sides are optimized for easy flipping and turning (i.e. with a spatula). They also normally do not come with lids; I'm sure there are some out there, but even my All-Clad skillets didn't.  You can really only use a skillet for high-heat searing or frying due to their low profile. Don't bother trying to poach or even shallow-fry in one.  Sauté pans, on the other hand, have more height, and usually do come with lids. They're a little heavier, and don't make it as easy to turn, but they can also be used for shallow-frying and moist-heat cooking methods like braising or poaching.  I've seen people make sauce or chili in sauté pans as well; sometimes they're more convenient if you're only going to make a small quantity, since the large exposed surface area (relative to a saucepan) makes it easier to reduce sauces. It's a no-brainer if your recipe starts out with sautéing garlic, onions, vegetables, etc., and then has you adding the liquid ingredients; if you have a large enough sauté pan then you don't need to bother transferring to a saucepan afterward.  I think you've got it backwards; of the two options, a sauté pan is definitely the more versatile option. I use both, but if I only had the space or budget for one, I'd choose the sauté pan, because it can do everything a skillet can do (just not quite as well) and many more things a skillet is useless for. A skillet is really only necessary for people who do a lot of pan-searing.  Note that as commenter Owen suggests, there are ""French skillets"" sold which have higher bases; these are not really skillets, and are not normally sold with lids, but assuming you can find or improvise one, they would make semi-decent multi-taskers. I maintain that cast-iron skillets, while taller, are not nearly as versatile due to their reactive material and weight - I only ever use mine for searing/grilling.  ",3

"Realtime hardware/software [SEP] PC software/hardware [SEP] Realtime hardware/software versus PC software/hardware, how are these distinct and alike? [SEP] In general, the difference between ""normal"" and ""real-time"" is some sort of guarantee on the time it takes to complete job. In a normal system, usually you have no guarantees at all. Programs can get interrupted by other programs, the OS scheduler might not be completely fair, the processor does complicated things that alter the runtime between executions of the same code...  For most applications this does not matter.  Real-time systems are built such that one can guarantee that job X is always completed after at most Y seconds. This is important for example for the chip that decides when to deploy air bags--if that takes longer than expected, you're dead. To be able to give these guarantees you have to use special operating systems (or no operating system at all) that guarantees appropriate scheduling. It is also necessary to know a lot of details about the hardware you're using. Does your chip have a cache? What kind of replacement policy does it use? How many cycles does an addition take? Is that always the same number? What's the branch prediction algorithm? etc.  Many people confuse real-time systems with very powerful processors that can churn through data ""in real time"". But that's not (always) the case. The important thing is not how long it takes in absolute time, the important part is that it never takes longer than expected. There are trade-offs both in hard- and software between throughput (expected computation speed) and predictability (worst-case speed).  ",2

"IntelliJ [SEP] Eclipse [SEP] How is IntelliJ better than Eclipse? [SEP] I work with Intellij (9.0.4 Ultimate) and Eclipse (Helios) every day and Intellij beats Eclipse every time.   How? Because Intellij indexes the world and everything just works intuitively. I can navigate around my code base much, much faster in Intellij. F3 (type definition) works on everything - Java, JavaScript, XML, XSD, Android, Spring contexts. Refactoring works everywhere and is totally reliable (I've had issues with Eclipse messing up my source in strange ways). CTRL+G (where used) works everywhere. CTRL+T (implementations) keeps track of the most common instances that I use and shows them first.   Code completion and renaming suggestions are so clever that it's only when you go back to Eclipse that you realise how much it was doing for you. For example, consider reading a resource from the classpath by typing getResourceAsStream(""/ at this point Intellij will be showing you a list of possible files that are currently available on the classpath and you can quickly drill down to the one you want. Eclipse - nope.  The (out of the box) Spring plugin for Intellij is vastly superior to SpringIDE mainly due to their code inspections. If I've missed out classes or spelled something wrong then I'm getting a red block in the corner and red ink just where the problem lies. Eclipse - a bit, sort of.  Overall, Intellij builds up a lot of knowledge about your application and then uses that knowledge to help you write better code, faster.  Don't get me wrong, I love Eclipse to bits. For the price, there is no substitute and I recommend it to my clients in the absence of Intellij. But once I'd trialled Intellij, it paid for itself within a week so I bought it, and each of the major upgrades since. I've never looked back.  ",2
"0 [SEP] 5 [SEP] SSD raid array, should I pick 0 or 5? [SEP] Advantages of RAID 5 in your setup:    You can add disks to increase the storage without having to reinstall the operating system or recover data.  RAID 5 is fault tolerant.  You are very very unlikely to have more than one disk fail at the same time (although I did just see this for the first time at a client - gulp), so there is much less chance of having to rebuild your system from scratch  If a disk fails with RAID 5, you can simply replace the disk and rebuild/resync the array.  If a single disk fails with RAID 0, bye bye data on both disks.  If you were to stick with RAID 0 and a daily backup, restoring from the backup would result in data loss between when the last backup was taken and when the disks failed.    Disadvantages of RAID 5 in your setup:    There is a performance hit when writing, over a RAID 0 striped array.  You need at least 3 disks.  You effectively lose the capacity of one of the disks (although the parity data is spread across all disks).    RAID 5 is common for business servers that hold mission critical data and require maximum uptime.  Otherwise, if speed is the dominating requirement in your setup and a loss of maybe a few hours work is acceptable, then go for RAID 0.  ",1

"symlinks [SEP] hard links [SEP] What are the advantages of symlinks over hard links and viceversa? [SEP] This has been discussed in some detail on ServerFault.  A hard link traditionally shares the same file system structures (inode in unixspeak), while a soft-link is a pathname redirect.     Hardlinks must be on the same filesystem, softlinks can cross filesystems.  Hardlinked files stay linked even if you move either of them (unless you move one to another file system triggering the copy-and-delete mechanism). Softlinked files break if you move the target (original), and sometimes when you move the link (Did you use an absolute or relative path? Is it still valid?).  Hardlinked files are co-equal, while the original is special in softlinks, and deleting the original deletes the data. The data does not go away until all hardlinks are deleted.  Softlinks can point at any target, but most OS/filesystems disallow hardlinking directories to prevent cycles in the filesystem graph (with the exception of the . and .. entries in unix directories which are hard links).  Softlinks can require special support from filesystem walking tools. Read up on readlink (2).    (Some details brought back to mind by mat1t. Thanks.)  ",1

"Sochi [SEP] Khanty-Mansiysk [SEP] Biathlon World Cup in Russia: Sochi or Khanty-Mansiysk? [SEP] First of all, it's definitely Sochi (but sounds more like TCH), this is official transliteration of the Ч.  Secondary, as others mentioned, you must do a stop during your flight at Moscow - unfortunately, in Russia many flights are made with such stop. I suggest you to stop for a day in Moscow, just for another sightseeing there.    Also:  Flight duration from Moscow to Sochi - 2 hours  Flight duration from Moscow to Khanty-Mansiysk - 3 hours, and flight by is made from other airport than you'll land from Frankfurt!, if you choose the UTAir.  You can choose the TransAero, but it's not as cheap as Sochi flight.  And most important part: sightseeing and weather.   Khanty-Mansiysk's average temperature is -9,8 °С, and sometimes there is cold weather,  down to -40.1 °С (March, 1st, 1966).  Sochi's average temperature is +15 °С, with sea temperature up to +9 °С. You can try it out - extreme, but quite fun :) There will be a snow machines for Biathlon in Sochi, but natural snow is in Khanty-Mansiysk.  As for the sightseeing, in Khanty-Mansiysk is all about the World Cup - people there love skiing, and you will be bored there if you are not a fan of it. There are quite small quantity of the sights in Khanty-Mansiysk (in Russian), and even less of them you'll be interested in during cold weather.  As for Sochi, you'll find much more fun there - because it is a very popular touristic center during long time. And because of preparing for the Olympic games, there are much more easier for foreign tourist to get information about city - people started to study languages, and whole touristic situation changed in a good way.  So, make your choice, but if I were you, I'd start with Sochi (plus 1-2 days stop in Moscow) - for start it will be enough. But if you want some extreme - choose the Khanty-Mansiysk, it will be a journey of the year for you.  ",2

"microkernel [SEP] monolithic kernel [SEP] Performance of microkernel vs monolithic kernel [SEP] As is always the answer (or at least the preface) to performance-related questions: know your problem domain, run comparative benchmarks, and remember what premature optimization is.  First, no comprehensive benchmarking trials have compared monolithic kernels to current-generation microkernel systems that operate in an equivalent manner. So, while there may be trials that compare specific elements of those kernels, they're not going to be representative of the ""big picture"" that your question is looking to paint.  With that being said, there are wildly divergent observations of kernel performance across microkernels; for example, the L4 microkernel family can be said to have IPC performance an order of magnitude higher than the Mach kernel. But every Apple device from this decade is running Mach, and they seem to work plenty fast, right?  The moral of the story is that anybody who's deciding what kernel architecture to use needs to first decide what their ultimate goal is. Microkernel systems are (when properly implemented, of course) more secure, maintainable, and modular. However, they can be tough to architect properly, and may have performance overhead over a monolithic implementation. A monolithic kernel will be faster, but security will be harder to implement and it will be less modular and less easy to customize.  Your kernel architecture should be based on what your end goal is.  (And when all else fails, try it both ways and see what happens.)  ",1

"graduate in three years [SEP] four [SEP] Better chances for math grad school: graduate in three years or four? [SEP] What jumps out at me in your question is the assumption that because of your advanced standing you can only stay at Berkeley for two years and thus only spend three years in college altogether.  Though I do not have any direct experience with this (i.e., financial aid at state universities in California), I find that quite surprising.  Berkeley is an elite institution, and presumably they don't let just anyone transfer in.  The fact that you have two years' worth of university credit after one year in college is to your credit and probably factored into their decision to accept you.  So they turn around and penalize you by only offering you two years of financial aid?  That doesn't make much sense.   I would at least make a phone call and, if necessary, schedule an in-person appointment with a financial aid officer.  My first guess, honestly, is that you may not be understanding the situation correctly.  If you are, you need to explain why the junior standing could stop you from making best use of the amazing resources that UC Berkeley has to offer and could make you less competitive in your later academic plans.  I would expect them to be sympathetic to that.  On the other hand, I find your discussion of what it takes to get into a top mathematics program (here and in the other question you asked) a bit reductive.  It is not simply a matter of taking the most graduate courses, doing multiple REUs (in my opinion as someone who was involved in graduate admissions in my math department, one REU has the same effect as multiple REUs unless you do some truly notable research in one of the REUs, which is unusual; also, doing multiple REUs makes it natural for you to get more than one recommendation letter from an REU director, and this is a mistake: most REU letters sound the same no matter who is writing them or is being written about), and so forth: the goal that you rather want to pursue is to show mastery of mathematics and show the potential and the interest in doing mathematical research.  You can show this by taking 5 graduate courses rather than 10.  (Ten courses sounds almost ridiculously high, by the way: I took 9 trimester graduate courses -- so the equivalent of 6 semester courses -- over the last two years of my undergraduate program.  I got into all the top mathematics departments.  If I had taken a few courses fewer I don't think the outcome would have changed.)    In fact, the list of math courses that you've already taken compares well with what very strong undergraduates take up through the end of their second year in top mathematics programs in the US.  If you did really well with them, then I think you would be ready to take graduate courses (what other undergraduate courses would you take?) in your next year and thus as far as I can see you could graduate in three years and still be competitive for a top program.  But do you really have to?  If you are serious about studying mathematics, then you have the entire rest of your life to do that.  I would recommend a more balanced undergraduate experience that is not 100% calculated to optimize the graduate program you can get into and which lasts for the traditional four years: there are other interesting courses to take as an undergraduate which you will never take again, and there are other things to do with one's undergraduate life aside from coursework.  Don't get shortchanged on your undergraduate experience.  ",3

"choosing maths [SEP] stats PhD programme [SEP] Any risks down the line choosing maths vs. stats PhD programme? [SEP]   Provided one can find a supervisor who has the background and research interestes that would allow one to keep extending ones pure mathematical toolbox are there any major risks in going for a PhD in stats?    There's a small risk, but it can be managed.  The first issue is that you need to make the mathematical content of your work very clear, for example by publishing in journals that could be considered both math journals and statistics journals (e.g., IMS journals).  However, if you're interested in math departments I assume you'd be doing that anyway.  The slightly more subtle issue is how mathematicians view statisticians.  There's sometimes a mild prejudice that people in mathematical statistics are overly specialized and outside of the mainstream of mathematics.  For example, it's possible to get a Ph.D. in mathematical statistics while having considerably less breadth of mathematical background than would be considered acceptable for a math grad student.  (Of course, the flip side is that you are expected to know other things instead.)  There's sometimes a fear that a statistician would be unlikely to talk much with other math department members, or might be unwilling or unable to teach anything but statistics.  Plenty of statisticians have found jobs in math departments, so I don't want to be discouraging.  However, I'd recommend focusing on mathematical breadth.  For example, if you work with people in combinatorics or algebra, then it will be clear to everyone why a math department is a natural fit.  If you talk only to statisticians, it will be less clear.  It can still work out even then, but generally when the department either has a thriving statistics group or has decided they really need a statistician (and either way this cuts down on the flexibility of your job search).

I personally don't look at the number of cores, but I look for the sweet price / performance spot when it comes to processors.  Normally Intel have their high end processor with their highest clock speed, and number of cores that is really expensive. I then look at the lower clock speed versions of that processor and find that there is a reasonably priced high end processor. Not the highest end processor, but still a really good one for a good price.  I then take the money I would have spent on the processor and use it to put as much memory in the machine as it will take / I can afford.

"modal music [SEP] tonal music [SEP] What's the difference between ""modal music"" and ""tonal music""? [SEP] ""Modal"" and ""tonal"" both describe works that:    have one defined ""home"" pitch, or ""tonal center,"" around which the melody and harmony are based;  have only one tonal center at a time, though that tonal center can change throughout a piece; and  use a seven-note diatonic scale as their pitch collections.    The difference between modal and tonal are in the harmonic languages surrounding the tonal center.  Tonality implies the system of common-practice harmony well-established by the eighteenth century that uses major and minor keys.  The tonal center of a tonal work is the first note of the major or minor scale in use as the pitch collection.  The harmonic implications of tonality are more than just the use of major and minor scales, as functional harmony is also a feature of tonal music.  The progression from the dominant sonority (a major triad with or without a minor seventh from the triad root based on the fifth note of the major or minor scale in use, or a similar-sounding substitute such as a fully-diminished seventh chord based on the leading tone) to the tonic triad to end a work is just one characteristic of functional harmony.  This characteristic is so important that, if the dominant sonority is instead a minor chord (thereby lacking the leading tone), the work no longer sounds tonal.  This means that even in a minor key, the seventh note of the scale is very often raised so that it becomes the leading tone.  Modal music uses diatonic scales that are not necessarily major or minor and does not use functional harmony as we understand it within tonality.  The term modal is most often associated with the eight church modes.  The tonal center of these modes is called its ""final.""  All the church modes use a pattern of half and whole steps that could be played on the white keys of a piano.  You may notice that there are only four different patterns among the church modes; the difference between e.g. ""dorian"" and ""hypodorian"" is whether the final occurs at or near the bottom of the melodic range or whether the final occurs in the middle of the melodic range.  The term ""modal"" has expanded in more modern music to encompass any non-tonal music that uses a diatonic pitch collection and has a tonal center.  There are many types of music other than modal and tonal.  Some examples include:    chromatic music, which uses all twelve of the standard Western pitch classes instead of the diatonic pitch collection, and which may or may not have a tonal center;  serial music, sometimes called ""dodecaphonic,"" which is chromatic music that intentionally avoids a tonal center, often by avoiding repetition of a pitch class until all twelve pitch classes have been used;  bitonal or polytonal music, which uses multiple diatonic pitch collections and multiple tonal centers simultaneously;  microtonal music, which uses pitches with frequencies between those of the standard twelve Western pitch classes;  whole-tone music, which uses a six-note scale comprised entirely of whole steps; and  non-Western music, which uses a pitch collection outside the twelve Western pitches (this is not a good classification, as there are many cultures with many different kinds of music that are very different from one another in pitch collection).    I did not even touch on music that does not use pitches at all; for example, an unpitched percussion work would clearly not be modal or tonal.  There are entire books on functional harmony, modes, etc., but I hope this has been a reasonable summary to answer your question.  ",0
"Car rental [SEP] buying a car for 1 month [SEP] Car rental vs. buying a car for 1 month, when visiting the USA? [SEP] Buying option  For a one-month trip, I do not recommend buying and selling a car.  Although it probably could be done, let me address some of the complications with that first, then I'll discuss rentals:    A $3000 car will be old, and probably not very reliable. I would not trust a car in this price range to get me safely around the country without thorough inspection, or a long test-drive/break-in period first.  Certainly you could get lucky, and have absolutely no problems with a $3000 car for a month of road trips.  But it would really ruin your vacation, I expect, if the car broke down in the middle of Arizona, or wherever.  Selling a car takes time.  If you're willing to lose $2000 in the selling process, though, it would be easy.  You could probably unload it at any car dealership for $2000 less than you paid a month before.  Registration is a pain.  Typically when you buy a car, you will get a temporary tag, and then have 30 days (although in some states fewer, I believe) to get an official registration.  If your stay is 30 days or less, this may not be a problem, since you would not be required to get an official tag.  But if you have the car 31 days or longer, you'll have to stop by a DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles) in some state, and get a license plate.  And doing that typically requires proof of residence of that state, which you probably won't have.  It will likely also require a vehicle inspection, at minimum to ensure the car is not stolen, and in many states, to ensure it passes environmental regulations.  If you register the car in the same state where you buy it, it will probably pass environmental regulations.  But if you register it in another state, it's anybody's guess.  It may be difficult to find a company that will provide you (affordable) insurance for a car you just bought, if you are not a U.S. resident.  Depending on the states where you buy and sell your car, it may actually be impossible to sell your car so quickly after having bought it, because you may not have the title in your possession yet.  And even if you have a title signed over to you, that may not be sufficient to sell it--you may have to get the state DMV (wherever you register the vehicle) to send you a new official title in your name before you can sell it again.  Selling the car in another state may be difficult, but I don't know. If you sell it to a dealership, they will likely take over most of the paper work involved--assuming it's possible.    Rental option  There are much cheaper options for rentals than the one you quoted.  A quick look at kayak.com shows that a rental from LAX (Los Angeles, CA) and drop-off at LGA (New York City, NY) a month later can be had for as little as $1792 including tax. Of course that does not include fuel, and likely does not include extra insurance.  You also may or may not be able to take this vehicle into Canada.  Different rental agencies will have different policies (and possibly extra costs) for taking it into Canada.  You'll just have to ask.  This rental option may take you over your $2000 budget, but you might be able to cut corners by renting multiple vehicles at different times during your stay.  If you'll be staying in L.A. for a week, for instance, maybe use public transport while you're there, and only rent a car at the end of your stay for the next leg of your journey.   You can also count on a more reliable car. If you pick a nation-wide rental company, they might change your car along the way in agencies and you have customer support if you have any mechanic problem. You also drive a quite recent car.  ",2

"active pickups [SEP] Passive Pickups [SEP] What are the benefits and drawbacks of active pickups? [SEP] [REF]    Passive Pickups: Passive pickups send a low output, raw signal to the amp that can only be affected by the volume and tone controls on the instrument itself. Passive pickups tend to lose the extremes of high and low frequencies, but still give a very even and punchy tone. This is because passive pickups tend to push out more midrange frequencies. While passive pickups might give players less dynamic control, their smooth sound is still very unique and desirable.  Active Pickups: Active pickups have preamps that are built into the pickup housing; so they can drive the signal to the amp themselves. This preamp must be powered by a source other than the amp, so active pickups require a separate battery to operate. This allows the pickup to send a higher output signal, producing a more complete, full-range sound than most passive pickup systems and giving players more control of instrument dynamics, projection and tone.

"to use a table of tables [SEP] dynamically created tables [SEP] For user defined data, is it better to use a table of tables or dynamically created tables? [SEP] A generic database design limits the proliferation of new tables as the number of forms and data elements grows. On the other hand even the simplest query involved 3 tables, in our case.   Queries indeed got very mind boggling. After 3 years of this I became of the opinion that explicit tables was better. I'd rather deal with more tables that better reflect the business form/model - that I can understand just by looking at them; vice 1/2 the tables but with multitudes of meaningless join tables requiring astonishing long, nested queries to make even the most rudimentary sense out of the data. You actually start memorizing the meaning/context of individual identity column primary keys!  Finally, we had evolved to where we had that one table to rule them all so as to get away from some of the inherent complexities (and bad coding and design decisions of the past) in the existing design and evolving user requirements. Nonetheless, we were certain we'd have problems as the table size went into the million+ row size.  ",3

"grape [SEP] cherry tomatoes [SEP] What is the difference between grape and cherry tomatoes? [SEP] The difference in their name is - not surprisingly - because of their form. Cherry tomatoes are round, while grape tomatoes are more oblong. Wikipedia mentions that grape tomatoes are 'sweet as cherry tomatoes', so not much difference in flavour according to this. Perhaps grape tomatoes are more similar to small plum tomatoes.  This site claims grape tomatoes to be sweeter, having a thicker skin and a lower water content than cherry tomatoes. Interestingly, it also says that grape tomatoes are a cross between cherry tomatoes and other tomatoes.  The claims of the second site are in agreement with this site (""grape tomatoes have thicker skin, lower water content and intense sweetness""). It also states ""a grape tomato is half the size of a cherry tomato"", so perhaps they are smaller. Due to the lower water content, grape tomatoes have less chance of 'squirting' when being bitten into.  ",1
"DPLL [SEP] brute force [SEP] Why is DPLL better than brute force? [SEP] Local (stochastic) search is all about clever navigation of the search space.  DPLL's advantage is pruning the search space of large swaths of assignments that provably cannot satisfy the formula.  DPLL does this by incrementally building partial assignments (some variables assigned values, some left unassigned), applying the unit propagation and pure literal rules and then checking if the resulting formula is trivially unsatisfiable.  If the simplified formula implied by the partial assignment contains an empty clause, DPLL need not try assigning values to the remaining unassigned variables since the empty clause represents a clause that can never be satisfied under the partial assignment.  The time saved is exponential to the number of unassigned variables, and those skipped assignments are where DPLL improves on brute force sequential search.  ",2

"cornstarch [SEP] gelatine [SEP] Turkish delight: cornstarch or gelatine? [SEP] If you want to make real Turkish delight, use cornstarch and only cornstarch. Nowhere on the Balkan have I seen a gelatine-thickened Turkish delight. No Turkish person will recognize a gelatine-thickened candy as lokum. I would go as far as to insist that aromatzied sugar syrup+gelatine = gummi bear, while aromatized sugar syrup+cornstarch = Turkish delight, although some people will feel that this is pedantic.   Beside authenticity, gelatine-containing recipes are prone to weeping, I have seen questions about that around here.   Bottom line: I would always make it with cornstarch. This doesn't mean that candy made with gelatine can't be tasty; it is just that if you want what you get in a Turkish shop, you can't do it with gelatine.   ",2
"a gas [SEP] electric oven [SEP] When baking, is it better to use a gas or electric oven? [SEP] For baking cakes and breads it is important to control the humidity in the oven. In early stages of baking one typically needs the humidity to remain in the baking chamber, which is hard to do with a gas oven.  Two of the bakeries near my house use electric ovens with brick lined baking chambers; the other uses gas.   Expansion  Gas and electric ovens can be built to bake the same way if cost is not an issue.  Most home gas ovens will circulate the combustion products (mainly water vapor and carbon dioxide) in the cooking chamber.  As the flames burn, combustion products need to be vented out of the baking chamber.  Electric ovens also need vents in the baking chamber to help maintain the pressure as the air inside expands.  Steam is essential in the initial stages of baking for good crust formation in breads and crack-free cake surfaces. The oven cavity can hold much more steam than released from the gas combustion and it is my inference that the steam content of an electric oven will be higher  (I cannot find published steam measurements inside ovens). After the dough expansion, the vapor coming off of the dough or batter needs to removed quickly for browning and for the inside to cook well.  The constant flow in a gas oven makes it better at that. In an electric oven a peep or two during the last baking stages will handle excess moisture.    Two bakeries near my house use electric ovens, the other, which makes excellent French baguettes, uses a gas oven.  The baker there has had both electric and gas ovens and he prefers the caramelization of the gas oven.  But note that he can handle the moisture problem with the steam injector of his professional gas oven.  He also noted that using gas ovens require skill as they have temperature and moisture quirks.    Recipes may be adapted to either gas or electric ovens.  In the US the majority of recipes are designed for the electric oven (they're more popular).  ",1

"Ferrying Icelandic rental car [SEP] renting on Faroe Islands [SEP] Ferrying Icelandic rental car vs renting on Faroe Islands [SEP] Although all comments were helpful it seems this question is a bit specific to the situation, so here's the answer I found with research.   After contacting a few rental companies in Iceland and talking to the Smyril ferry lines, only one rental company, Reykjavik Cars, will allow the car to go off the island, whereas Smyril said it was ok on their side. Even within Europe, it still counts as taking the car to a different country so it's not without complications. (For comparison, rental agreements here in Canada allow you to drive the car across the border to a contiguous US state)  The Smyril fare for a car is the same for any model as long as the car fits their maximum dimensions. It's about 828 euros return with a car vs 370 without one. A quick search for a week's rent on the Faroes comes down to about 460 euros, it's actually about the same in expense but probably more practical to go on with the same car.  Flying return from KEF is about 1000$ when I checked. Keep in mind these prices are all for high season, June-July.  So the answer:  Cheapest seems to be flying actually, although rental fees are lower there is still gas to take into account. Most practical would be to ferry the Icelandic rental car across. And for anyone looking to ferry any rental car between countries, I'd recommend checking first with rental companies before the ferry lines.  ",1

The vast majority of graduate programs in the US accept both IELTS and TOEFL.  A program that does have a preference will say so in its admission instructions. For example, BU engineering prefers TOEFL:    In addition to the required credentials for applications, international students must demonstrate an understanding of English, including the ability to read and write with ease. International students are required to submit scores from or the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) that meet our minimum requirements. If the TOEFL is not available, we will accept scores from the International English Language Testing System (IELTS).    and MIT Material Science and Engineering only accepts IELTS:    If your first language is not English, you will need to submit an IELTS test score. Please note: this department does not accept TOEFL scores under any circumstances.    While Stanford only accepts TOEFL:    Stanford does not accept IELTS scores.

"Stansted [SEP] Cambridge [SEP] Which airport has better connections with the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus in Hinxton, Stansted or Cambridge? [SEP] As you've probably discovered the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus in very much Cambridgeshire not Cambridge itself. In fact, it's about a third of the way to Stansted!  Cambridge airport is small, so your time from plane to kerb will be very quick. Stansted, not so much...  By taxi, it's about 12 miles from Cambridge airport to Hinxton. If you've pre-booked a minicab, it should take about 25 minutes. A metered local taxi would be about £30, but you can probably negotiate a lower fare if you pre-book a minicab. I'm not sure there are taxis waiting at the airport normally, as it's small, so you might need to book anyway.  By bus from Cambridge airport, you'd need to get a bus into town (11 or 77), then either a Citi 7 to nearby, or the Park and Ride bus to the Babraham Road Park-and-Ride then the 7A to Hinxton. Plan for about 1.5-2 hours  From Stansted, in a taxi it'll only be about 30 minutes, as it's a motorway almost the whole way. Downside is it's 20 miles, with an airport pickup surcharge, so it'll be quite a bit more money than Cambridge. My hunch is about £45 for a local taxi, less if you pre-book a minicab and negotiate something.  Public transport from Stansted to Hinxton isn't great though. You can ask Google Maps, but the fact that it often suggests taking a train from Stansted to London then train London to Cambridge then bus then walk should give you some idea... There doesn't look to be any local buses covering the route, so you're pretty much stuck with train or long distance coach to Cambridge (passing Hinxton on the motorway without stopping), then basically the same local buses as you'd have got from Cambridge airport.  If it were me, and the flight costs were about the same, I'd suggest flying to Cambridge, bus into town, enjoy a little bit of time in the city centre, then taxi out to Hinxton. Likely to be much more enjoyable than via Stansted, and given the queues you often encounter at Stansted it may even be quicker even with an hour's sightseeing / eating / drinking in Cambridge!  ",3
"bagged mulch [SEP] city mulch [SEP] What are the pros and cons of bagged mulch versus city mulch? [SEP] Dark color is not necessarily a sign of healthy compost/mulch. If it's dyed, the color is from chemicals, not humus. Not so healthy. Bagged mulch must tell you if it's dyed or not, so read the bag. If there's no mention of dye, you're good.   Now, because the (undyed) color doesn't affect the health of the product, using the city mulch is still a good idea, unless you want color for aesthetic purposes. So:    Bagged mulch if dyed will retain it's color much longer, and if undyed, most likely still a good bit longer, because bagged mulch is a much higher quality product than free city mulch. But remember, for soil health, it's not all about the color.  Yes, undyed bagged mulch will be at least as good for the soil as the city stuff. If dyed, you will be adding that much chemical dye to your soil.  Yes. Here are a few:    Bagged Mulch (undyed)    (+) is much more consistent in texture and quality  (+) is not going to contain as many possible contaminates like chipped black walnut limbs (a common issue with city mulch)  (+) the color usually lasts fairly well, even when not dyed, because of proper 'cooking' methods and a more decomposed state  (-) is much more expensive (obviously), which tends to limit the amount applied, which can (in some cases) decrease the rate at which your soil is improved    City Mulch    (+) It's available in bulk, so you can supply your garden with as much as necessary without running up a big bill  (+) Usually, the stuff is good enough for use in garden beds, some cities are more careful than others, though  (-) The texture can be extremely uneven, and will break down irregularly, because of the many various species that went into it.  (-) color fades fast, especially if the mulch hasn't decomposed for long. This is only aesthetic.        ",2

"Talks [SEP] poster presentations [SEP] Talks vs. poster presentations: Which is better for advertising your research and building research networks? [SEP] It depends on what you want to do. If you feel like at this point in your research it would be more beneficial to converse than to present, then I'd say that a poster session is the right venue for you. It's true that talks are considered a bit more prestigious than poster sessions, but you really should go with what you think will be more valuable for you, and for the conference attendees.  It's worth noting that you could always do a poster presentation this year, get the feedback that you covet, and then return next year to do a talk, and let everyone know how your research went over the subsequent year. That kind of progression is not a bad thing.  Also, if you are in the early stages of your research, it might not be ready for a talk. When I attend a conference talk, I'm expecting there to be some significant findings. Sure, talks might be more ""prestigious,"" but, if there are some holes in your research, you could end up discrediting yourself. People aren't expecting the same level of maturity in the research during a poster session. So, as I said before, forget the prestige aspect, and choose what is more fitting based on your goals, and on what you have to share at this point in your research.  ",3
"to learn the DOM [SEP] jQuery [SEP] Is it better to learn the DOM or jQuery first? [SEP] Learn the DOM.

With all that given, I don't think there is anything wrong with learning the DOM alongside jQuery. Especially if you have a project that requires JQuery and needs to get done relatively soon. I think the important thing is that you learn how the DOM works in order to keep yourself decoupled from any particular library.  ",2

"on a week day [SEP] a weekend [SEP] Will the traffic and parking be easier in York on a week day or a weekend? [SEP] York is a difficult place for the motorist at any time. For the obvious historical reasons the city centre is not geared up for anything but light-to-reasonable traffic but does have a linked series of single-carriageway roads circumnavigating the Roman Walls to help motorists avoid traversing the city centre itself.   A few miles further out you have an outer ring road which is dual carriageway on the South and Eastern sides (A64), and single-lane on the West and Northern sides. Parking is severely restricted in the centre although there are a few small car parks if you wish to gamble on driving to the centre and finding a space. York counteracts this by having 5 or 6 Park and Rides (info here) dotted around the outer ring road, with judicious use of bus lanes to move visitors and workers into the city centre reasonably efficiently and as York isn't a huge city it's a fairly quick journey.  During the week you have office workers and tourists; at weekends you have shoppers and tourists. The differential between traffic levels between the two is minimal, in my experience. York is generally busy traffic-wise whichever day of the week you would choose to go.  ",1
"Homebase in Phoenix [SEP] Scottsdale [SEP] Biking in Arizona: Homebase in Phoenix or Scottsdale? [SEP] It depends on whether you want relatively flat trails or mountain biking, as you didn't say.  The Scottsdale Green Belt is a paved trail several miles in length that begins just north of Shea Boulevard and ends in Tempe.  There are only a few places on the trail that require crossing a street, as there are lots of tunnels that pass below busy streets.  There would be dozens of hotels located along this path, ranging from simple motel-like accommodations to pricey resorts.  Here is a map of the path and various connections.  For mountain biking, I recommend South Mountain in Phoenix which is the largest city park in the world.  There are more than 10 different trails in South Mountain ranging from 1 mile in length to 14 miles (58 miles total).  Difficulty ranges from moderate to difficult.  There are also several hotels/resorts in the South Mountain area.  You could also check for accommodations in the Ahwatukee area of Phoenix just south of the mountain.  Note that it is just starting to warm up here -- late April and it was over 100 °F (38 °C) here today (I live in Gilbert, just SE of Phoenix).

[SEP] First, note that a course on OOP is probably not the same as a course just on C++. The C++ language was designed by Stroustrup to support the developer in multiple styles of programming, including OO.  C++ today has become such a huge and complex language, moreover one for which which professional programming style has significantly evolved since the 98 standard.

Now, it's a long while since I've had a look at Deitel and Deitel, and I can't say I've good memories of it. However, hopefully the book is recommended because does take an approach supporting the OOP of the course and the subset of C++ you are expected to learn on the course. So go ahead and get the book.  Having said that, if you really want to learn C++ itself well enough to be able to use it as a professional, be prepared to buy a few more books and put in a lot more work after you've done this introductory course.

"early blight [SEP] late blight [SEP] Tomatoes...what is the difference between early blight and late blight? [SEP] Here's the biggest difference: Late blight is caused by the pathogen Phytophthora infestans, while early blight is caused by Alternaria solani.  Phytophthora infestans is an oomycete, a fungus-like eukaryotic microorganism. It is similar to Alternaria solani (a fungus) in that it is a localized disease, and doesn't spread internally. P. infestans is a more aggressive disease, and spreads much faster than A. solani. It also kills all infected material, causing dark, watery spots to form. these eventually become hard and brown.  Control of P. infestans is very difficult. There is no cure for badly infected plants.    If you notice signs of infection, remove all affected parts and destroy them.  If the disease spreads anyway, destroy the entire plant.    You can prevent it to some extent by:    Rotating your crops every year, remembering that both tomatoes and potatoes are susceptible to P. infestans.  Destroying all affected crops as soon as possible. Remove them from the site, and burn them, or place in air-tight bags and send to the landfill. Do not compost.  Growing resistant varieties like 'Defiant', 'Plum Regal', 'Mountain Magic 'and 'Mountain Merit'    Control of A. solani is easier, but it's best to prevent the disease, or catch it early. From: Sudden Outbreak of Yellow Leaves on Tomato (and Other) Plants:    Remove all leaves showing signs of early blight (yellowing, dry margin, large to small round dead spots.)  Do not touch the unaffected leaves with the removed portions, or your hands until they are thoroughly washed.  Spray with a copper fungicide (like BONIDE© Liquid Copper Fungicide). Apply once every 5 days, and after any rain. Continue for 3-4 weeks, or until the plant stops developing the symptoms.     To prevent future attacks, you can try to:    Minimize soil-foliage contact  Make sure the plants get good air circulation (including proper spacing)  When you water, try not to wet the foliage, or splash soil onto the leaf undersides. The fungus spreads faster in wet conditions.  To go along with that, an organic mulch will help keep soil from splashing, and is also useful for many other reasons.  Make sure the plants have a support to climb on.  Rotate the plantings each year, to stop pathogens from inhabiting the soil. Remember that potatoes are also vulnerable to early blight, so plan accordingly.    ",1

"Sight Read [SEP] Memorising [SEP] Piano--Sight Read vs Memorising [SEP] Sorry for the obvious answer here, but though everyone has strengths and weakness, you do get better at what you practice well and after 20-30 years of practice, your skills reflect first what you worked on most.    In this bunch, I am good at sight reading, good at reading notes, can    only memorise with both hands; bad at rhythm, bad at memorising.    One possible explanation among others to your situation:  The memory most people have (and the first to go away when under stress) is finger memory. It comes from playing the piece over and over and doesn't require much understanding of the piece.  If you are good at sight reading, chances are you quickly play hands together and thus acquire that finger memory. And chances are also that you rely on the music sheet heavily (since you read well) and don't have to challenge your memory.   Bad at memorizing can mean many things: that it goes away with stress, that it takes a long time to come to you, etc.  Take a short piece and explore a different approach: practice it diligently with hands separately for a much longer time; try to play it from memory after just a few passes, even if you don't know it yet; then as you start playing it from memory, start randomly from anywhere in the piece, and chances are that you will find yourself having a very strong memorization for that piece, pretty quickly, playing it with both hands or only one hand.  My point here being that even though everyone has different inherent skill, I suspect that a lot of what you consider as a given comes from your playing habits.  ",1

"to submit a paper to a journal ""normal"" issue [SEP] send it to a more focused ""special section"" of the same journal [SEP] Is it better to submit a paper to a journal ""normal"" issue, or wait 4 months and send it to a more focused ""special section"" of the same journal? [SEP] There's another alternative. You can submit to the special issue early.  Usually journals don't have ""easier"" submission to a special issue or section. Most journals try to have the same review and editing criteria for such contributions as they do for other articles. (Consider that having different criteria makes it harder for them to process and track such articles.) I can attest - I had a manuscript that was asked for significant revision and it didn't make the ""special issue"" by the time we'd revised it.  But you can submit the article and ask for inclusion in the special issue and explain that you have the manuscript done now. They will probably send it for review, etc. but it won't be published until the remainder of the special section is finished as well.  I've done this. It gets the paper off your desk and lets you move on to other things.  What are the pros and cons?:    Pro: Usually a special section or special issue gets added attention and publicity. I haven't seen analysis, but one would hope that articles in this section or issue would have more readers and potentially more citations than in a normal issue.  Con: You will have to wait for the special issue to finalize, while if you submit to the ""regular"" journal, publication will probably happen sooner. On the other hand, if the journal publishes accepted articles before publication, or you can put the manuscript on a pre-print server, there's little downside.    Personally, I'd submit early, indicate in the submission letter (and online forms) that the article is for the special section and be done with it.  ",0

"to go to graduate school at same school as undergrad [SEP] to go to a lower-ranked school [SEP] Which is preferable, to go to graduate school at same school as undergrad or to go to a lower-ranked school? [SEP]   I've heard from people that generally, it's a bad idea to go to the same school as your undergrad to get your graduate education.     The word ""generally"" is commonly used in two rather different senses.  The first sense is ""typically"", ""most often"".  The second sense -- perhaps more common in mathematical and scientific writing -- is ""always"", or ""in the largest possible scope which might be applied"".  The quoted advice is valid if ""generally"" is construed in the former sense, not the latter.  To briefly explain: on the one hand, there are advantages to acquiring a diversity of experience.  ""Great University X"" will do its business in a way which is slightly different from ""Great University Y"".  Experiencing this is very valuable, because if you stay in academia you will probably be affiliated with several more universities, different from each of these.  If all of your student experience is at a single place, you will have subconsciously internalized the universality of your experience, and you'll be in for a rude awakening when you learn that what is obviously best to you is not the practice in your new environment.  Then too, by going to different great universities, you meet different great people (many of whom will know each other and will be in transit to/from other great universities), both students and faculty.  This is also very valuable.  On the other hand, there are situations where it is most advantageous to stay where you are.  For instance there are sometimes personal, family or financial considerations.  Even neglecting these, there are times that the university you attended as an undergraduate is truly the uniquely best option for you to continue your studies, or the best option among those available to you.  If you are an undergraduate at UCLA, if you want to study analysis, and if you did not get admitted to Berkeley, MIT, Chicago, Princeton or Stanford, then staying where you are sounds like an excellent (perhaps optimal) choice academically.  If you've already done successful research with a top faculty member at your current program and you truly want to continue that research most of all: yes, think seriously about staying right where you are.    The other answer says that graduate school rankings is ""a little ridiculous"".  While I don't really disagree, let me try to put a finer point on that: grad school rankings are ridiculous if you take them too seriously, and especially if you regard them as a strict linear ranking.  It does not matter that US News and World Report currently thinks that MIT is the best mathematics department in the US whereas in past years it used to think it was some combination of Harvard / Princeton / Berkeley.  It would be more honest and more helpful if they simply recorded that these departments and several others (Chicago, Stanford,...) are in the uppermost echelon of graduate programs in mathematics.  Asking whether Harvard is better than Stanford is ridiculous: it depends upon what you're studying.  (If you want to study analysis, don't go to Harvard unless you know you want to work with the one faculty member there who does that.)    Students should be thinking of departments in terms of echelons.  Within a given echelon, ranking is not helpful.  However, barring some truly exceptional circumstances you want to go to a program in the top echelon that accepts you.  As a corollary to this: if your undergraduate institution is in the top 10, and every other program you've gotten into isn't in the top 30, then yes, I think you should stay where you are, unless you have a very good reason to go to a lower-ranked department (best reason: there is a superstar there that has agreed to work with you).    Finally though I have to say that I find it slightly odd that the OP has apparently gone to a top department, been admitted as a student to that top department, but not at any other department of comparable quality.  That suggests to me that her application is not as strong as it could be, as those who know her in real life apparently value her more highly.  ",2
"Buy alcohol duty-free [SEP] in US [SEP] Buy alcohol duty-free or in US? [SEP] I am told, the problem with them Indian customs is, you can read them boys all the rules from the book, but if they see you with more than 2 average sized (750 ml ?) alcoholic bottles, you have had it. By the book, you can carry 2 liters of alcohol :   [REF]    3. What are the norms for the import of Alcoholic drinks /  Cigarettes as baggage?  Following quantities of Alcoholic drinks and Tobacco products  may be included for import within the duty free allowances  admissible to various categories of incoming passengers :  - Alcoholic liquors or Wines upto 2 litres  - 200 Cigarettes or 50 Cigars or 250 gms. of Tobacco.  The rate of duty applicable on these products over and  above the above mentioned free allowance is as under :  (i) Cigarettes BCD @100%+ educational cess  @ 3%  (ii) Whisky BCD @150% + ACD @ 4% + education  cess NIL.  (iii) Beer BCD @100% + ACD NIL + 3% education  cess    The best option in experiences of people I know and as others here have suggested, it's best to buy in US, pack well and put it in the check in luggage. Many liquors are way cheaper in the state run package stores than what it is in any other package/beverage store. In case it helps,  I think last time I bought a Gelnlivet 18 year old 750 ml was 95 bucks. But you have to also keep in mind, the bottle weight of such liquor can get very heavy.   There shouldn't be any problem all along the way.   Just my personal suggestion; You get all the GLENLIVETs and GLENFIDDICHs in India for reasonable price.

"a Bachelor's thesis [SEP] Master's and PhD theses [SEP] What makes a Bachelor's thesis different from Master's and PhD theses? [SEP] The PhD thesis should be on a much higher level than the Honours/Masters thesis, offering a contribution to human knowledge that is of a sufficient level of ""significance"" to warrant publication in a respected journal.  Significance is highly subjective, and you also do not necessarily have to publish to be awarded the PhD (sometimes the peer-review delay means that they come out afterwards, or there may be some intellectual property issues that make it beneficial to refrain from publication). It is awarded based on your supervisors consent and a review of academics in your field. So the ""significance"" would probably be judged by them in terms of how much original work they see as a reasonable expectation at that stage of your development (first 3 years of serious/committed research). Unfortunately it also means that some people who probably do not deserve PhD's are awarded them anyway for fulfilling grunt work for their easy-going supervisors.  It is possible that some Honours/Masters thesis might even be more significant/higher quality than a PhD thesis. Unfortunately, this does not mean that the submission of the thesis will award the degree that they deserve. The university may have a policy to upgrade the student's enrolment if the supervisor senses that such progress is being made. However, it is impossible to upgrade to a PhD without completing Honours and I believe nearly every single university has a policy of a minimum period of enrolment before submission is allowed. A subsequent question that you may have is how to gain a PhD without enrolling in one, which is another level of achievement completely.  As for the difference between Honours/Bachelor and Masters it would depend on your university, but both have no requirement for publication quality research and are usually small tasks/ideas that are not worth the supervisors time to think about alone, or involve a lot of labor. In fact, in my school, many Honours thesis are of a higher level than the Masters, because the smart Honours students will either graduate into the work force or go straight into a PhD. The Masters students are usually those who cannot find a job and are not suited to research. However, I believe some other universities may require a mandatory Masters degree to start the PhD.  You may get a better idea by looking at some titles/abstracts of completed theses. The PhD level will be something like a new method/observation/application whereas the Masters/Honours will be an application specific set of measurements/simulations or even simply a literature review to gauge the needs of future work. The word limits are also typically different (although note that quality is NOT proportional to the number of words), with PhD at 100K, Masters at 50K and Honours at 30K at my university.  ",1

"reheats better on stove [SEP] in microwave [SEP] Why does Chinese food reheats better on stove than in microwave? [SEP] I believe it has more to do with HOW a microwave cooks or reheats food vs. the way a conventional stove top does it.  When you put something into a microwave to reheat it, it does not apply heat the way a stove does. Microwaves use their namesakes -microwave radiation- to jostle the molecules contained within the food, causing friction, which in turn causes heat, and heats up the food, from the inside out. This means that food with a higher density, such as meat or veggies, will heat up more quickly than liquids, which are less dense. Also, microwaves don't just heat up the food, but also the container, be it plastic, foam, or the stereotypical white paper boxes. When this happens, the particles within the container (which are being heated) will give off various chemicals, which can alter the taste of food.   When you reheat food on a stove top, you are using a container that is much more resistant to heat (a pan) and you are applying heat evenly, from the outside of the food, regardless of it's density. This means that the pan (90% of the time) will not alter the way your food tastes, and because everything is being heated at the same time and rate, your food tastes more like it did yesterday, or whenever it was that you brought it home.

"a LBA with stack [SEP] a LBA without [SEP] Is a LBA with stack more powerful than a LBA without? [SEP] Theorem The following are equivalent.    $L$ is accepted by a deterministic LBA with stack  $L$ is accepted by a nondeterministic LBA with stack  $L$ is in $\operatorname{DTIME}(c^n)$ for some constant $c$.    So the computational power of a LBA with stack for decision problems is well understood. The exponential runtime limits the usefulness of this knowledge in practice. But the notion of an LBA with stack can be generalized to an $S(n)$ auxiliary pushdown automaton ($S(n)$-AuxPDA). It consists of    a read-only input tape, surrounded by endmarkers,  a finite state control,  a read-write storage tape of length $S(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input string, and  a stack    In ""Hopcroft/Ullman (1979) Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation (1st ed.) we find:  Theorem 14.1 The following are equivalent for $S(n)\geq\log n$.    $L$ is accepted by a deterministic $S(n)$-AuxPDA  $L$ is accepted by a nondeterministic $S(n)$-AuxPDA  $L$ is in $\operatorname{DTIME}(c^{S(n)})$ for some constant $c$.    with the surprising:  Corollary $L$ is in $\mathsf P$ if and only if $L$ is accepted by a $\log n$-AuxPDA.  The proof consists of three parts: (1) If L is accepted by a nondeterministic $S(n)$-AuxPDA with $S(n)\geq \log n$, then $L$ is in $\operatorname{DTIME}(c^{S(n)})$ for some constant $c$. (2) If $L$ is in $\operatorname{DTIME}(T(n))$, then $L$ is accepted in time $T^4(n)$ by a deterministic one-tape TM with a very simple forward-backward head scan pattern (independent of the input). (3) If $L$ is accepted in time $T(n)$ by a deterministic one-tape TM with a very simple forward-backward head scan pattern (independent of the input), then $L$ is accepted by a deterministic $\log T(n)$-AuxPDA.  Part (1) is basically a rigorous proof that the ""halting problem is decidable"", where the number of operations was counted thoroughly. Part (2) is the creative idea that prepares the stage for part (3). Part (3) uses the auxiliary storage for tracking the time step, which allows to reconstruct the head position due to the very simple forward-backward head scan pattern, and the stack for recursive backtracking. (So this proof also contains the two observations which I wanted to make more rigorous. This answer is already long enough anyway, so I won't go into more detail here.)    This leads to the following answer for the initial question Is a LBA with stack more powerful than a LBA without?: The question is equivalent to a well know open problem, and the expectation is that it is indeed more powerful.

"a scripting language [SEP] a normal programming language [SEP] What is the difference between a scripting language and a normal programming language? [SEP] I think the difference has a lot more to do with the intended use of the language.  For example, Python is interpreted, and doesn't require compiling and linking, as is Prolog. I would classify both of these as programming languges.  Programming langauges are meant for writing software. They are designed to manage large projects. They can probably call programs, read files, etc., but might not be quite as good at that as a scripting language.  Scripting langauges aren't meant for large-scale software development. Their syntax, features, library, etc. are focused more around accomplishing small tasks quickly. This means they are sometimes more ""hackish"" than programming langauges, and might not have all of the same nice features. They're designed to make commonly performed tasks, like iterating through a bunch of files or performing sysadmin tasks, to be automated.  For example, Bash doesn't do arithmetic nicely, which would probably make writing large-scale software in it a nightmare.  As a kind of benchmark: I would never write a music player in perl, even though I probably could. Likewise, I would never try to use C++ to rename all the files in a given folder.  This line is becoming blurrier and blurrier. JavaScript, by definition a ""scripting"" langauge, is increasingly used to develop ""web apps"" which are more in the realm of software. Likewise, Python initially fit many of the traits of a scripting language but is seeing more and more sofware developed using Python as the primary platform.  ",1

"tuning-in-slide [SEP] bell tuning [SEP] What are the pros/cons of the ""tuning-in-slide"" method of trombone design? [SEP] Actually, American manufacturers (notably Conn and Olds) produced slide-tuning instruments well into the 1960s.  The design lasted longest in bass trombones (the Olds P24 and Conn 7xH).  S. E. Shires currently produces a slide-tuning alto and makes slide-tuning slides for tenors and basses on special order.  Kanstul makes a slide-tuning bass in its 1662 series and 1670 series, and a slide-tuning tenor in its 1688/1608 series.  Slide tuning has a substantial advantage for bass trombones because it allows a longer continuously tapered bell section.  Trombones are roughly 1/3 tapered and 2/3 cylindrical tubing.  A Bb/F bass trombone with slide tuning (and NO provision for bell tuning) can have a tapered tubing proportions that are approximately correct for the F side.  Of course, then it's too long for the Bb horn.  Slide tuning also allows for a longer slide section.  The Conn 62 has an in-tune low C without worrying about going off the inner slides.  Other instruments (notably the Bach 50) have the low C (on the F side alone) perilously near the end of the slide.  Shires went to slide tuning on his alto so that the instrument would have solid low A and E.  Other altos are notorious for having these notes almost off the slide.  Slide-tuning has two primary disadvantages.  First is weight: including the tuning mechanism in the slide necessarily increases the outer slide's weight.  More weight means more inertia means a slower slide.  Modern designs have much lower weight penalties than the designs of the 1960s.  The other problem is slide alignment.  A slide tuning instrument has more moving parts, which theoretically make it vulnerable to alignment problems.  As with all things musical, it is a matter of paying your money and taking your choice. Slide tuning and bell tuning trombones have different timbral and playing characteristics. Having a conical bell section generally gives a warmer sound than that of a bell tuning instrument. However, the conical bell section is very open and may require more air and effort from the player at louder dynamics.  ",1

"a barely passed grad course [SEP] no grad course at all [SEP] Would graduate committee be more favorable to a barely passed grad course or no grad course at all while undergrad [SEP] The big question that both your recommenders and the admissions committee will wonder about is what this experience predicts for you in graduate school.  If you do poorly when taking a grad class now, will you be able to do well in grad school?  One factor may be preparation.  Maybe you were enthusiastic but overly ambitious, and in another year you'll have the experience and preparation needed to do well.  This is the reassuring scenario.  Another possibility is that you're just not used to be challenged by courses, since the undergraduate program was not very demanding.  Now that you know what you face, you'll take it more seriously and do better.  It's entirely possible, but this scenario is more worrisome.  Lots of people say ""oh, next time I'll work harder,"" but this is easier said than done.  And there are even more worrisome possibilities.  For example, maybe you just didn't like the material and couldn't bring yourself to engage deeply with it.  This could be a symptom of lack of preparation, or it could be a sign that this field is not a good fit for you.  I'd recommend dropping the course.  In grad school there's no value in barely passing a course: if you need to learn something, then you need to really learn it well, not just avoid failing.  This means a bad grade on a transcript won't impress admissions committees, and it means you're going to have to go back and learn this material properly in the future anyway.  Probably you should take this course in grad school.  If you don't take it, then you'll need to put in some serious effort to master the material on your own.  Meanwhile, you should think about what went wrong and how to explain it to your recommenders, so that you reassure them regarding your future in grad school.  ",3

"MVP [SEP] MVC [SEP] Building websites, which is the better approach MVP or MVC? [SEP] I guess you're asking in the context of the Microsoft world?  It was my understanding that MVP was mainly employed for unit testing the controllers of the application. I think another term for the MVP pattern is Supervising Presenter.  The view in this case would be the ASP Page, which would have an instance of the Presenter, and any events in the page (click handler's for example) would delegate their work to the Presenter. The Presenter would have a reference to the View (although, through an IView interface that the Page would implement). The Presenter would then respond to actions from the View, do something, update the model and pass it back to the view or perform actions on the View via the interface.   This aids unit testing, because the Presenter (where any presentation logic should be) can have the view mocked out. Typically a Presenter would also have references to other services, which should rely on dependency injection (via constructor injection IMO) to also allow for the Presenter to be tested in isolation (a proper unit test).  The main reason I think to use MVP in ASP.NET WebForms is because the Page class is tied to the ASP.NET runtime, whereas because ASP.NET MVC has abstractions on things like the HttpRequest, and the controller and ActionResult classes can be tested in isolation, you don't need to employ MVP - it's unit testable by default.  So to answer (I think): I'd use MVP if I was using WebForms, to aid testability. Otherwise I'd use MVC.  Also check out the Web Client Software Factory, which offers a framework for a starter point for implementing the MVP pattern.  ",1
"Chomsky NF [SEP] Greibach NF [SEP] Chomsky NF or Greibach NF benefits for LR parser? [SEP] The point of generating a parser (usually) is to parse: ""Analyse (a string or text) into logical syntactic components"" (some online dictionary). That's different from simply recognizing that a text is a member of a language. A given language has a variety of grammars which will recognize its sentences, but typically there is a specific grammar which defines the ""logical syntactic components"" and their relationship to each other, as in the above definition. In real-world applications -- compilers, for example -- one expects an output which is more interesting than simply ""the input is/is not a valid program"".  In some cases, it is possible to recover the original parse tree from the parse tree generated by parsing a transformed grammar. (This is true for CNF, with the usual transformation strategy.) In other cases (such as GNF, as far as I know), it is annoyingly difficult, making such a transformation of limited use for parsing (as opposed to recognition).  Also, not all grammar transformations preserve LR(k)-ness. In particular, the usual CNF transformation involves refactoring of every production into a series of rules with precisely two non-terminals. This often has the effect of converting an LR(1) grammar into a grammar which is not LR(k) for any k. So that's not much help, either.  ",1

"microcoded [SEP] hardcoded architectures [SEP] Advantages and disadvantages of microcoded vs hardcoded architectures [SEP] The distinction between ""microcoded"" and ""hardcoded"" multi-cycle control units is a relatively small implementation detail.  The distinction was more important in the 1950s when people were inventing new implementation techniques for state machines.  In modern processor design there are much more important implementation distinctions, like how much pipelining and instruction overlap you are going to try to achieve, whether you are going to speculatively execute instructions, and whether you are going to try to schedule instructions out-of-order.  That said, here's the distinction:  We divide the design into datapath and control.  Here's the picture of the MIC-1 from Tanenbaum's Computer Organization book.  (The image is by Suyog.karnawat, from Wikimedia commons.)  Everything in the design is the datapath except the box in the upper right hand side that says ""Instruction decoder and control logic.""    The ""Insruction decoder and control logic"" box is a finite state machine.  The datapath in this example is very simple, with only a single bus, so even an instruction to add two registers and put the result in a third register takes multiple cycles (each of which corresponds to a state in the state machine.)  Each instruction goes through the following steps/states (each of which takes a cycle)    move the PC (Program Counter) to the MAR (Memory Address Register)  assert the controls to perform a load from the memory bus  eventually the memory will return the requested data (which corresponds to the next instruction) and put it in the MDR (Memory Data Register)  move the instruction from the MDR to the IR (Instruction Register).  At this point the instruction gets decoded and we figure out what to do with it.  In this case it's an add operation so we know we need to:  move Ra to the X register  put Rb on the bus (so that it will go to the B input of the ALU) assert the ALU control lines and Mux select appropriately to do an add operation, the result of which will get saved in register Y  Move Y to the Rc register, and then every non-branch instruction ends by incrementing the program counter:  Put the PC on the bus, set up the ALU to increment (Select the MUX to put constant 1 on the A input and set up the ALU to Add) so that PC+1 will get saved in the Y register  Move the Y register back to PC    So 9 state transitions to perform a simple add instruction.  So the ""Instruction decoder and control logic"" is a finite state machine with inputs from the IR register, outputs are the control signals, and there must be some flip-flops inside to represent the state of the state machine.  But there are lots and lots of ways to implement a state machine.    $\lceil \log_2 N \rceil$ flip-flops (where $N$ is the number of states) and a lot of combinational logic (to calculate the control signals and next state).  $N$ flip-flops with one-hot encoding and a bunch of combinational logic (usually less than with option A, but a lot.)  Somewhere between $\lceil \log_2 N \rceil$ and $N$ flip-flops with some combinational logic of intermediate complexity.    And the combinational logic for the control signals and next state functions can be implemented any number of ways:    As NAND gates reduced (using Quine-McCluskey, or whatever) to sum-of-products form.  As NAND gates reduced to some relatively efficient multiple-level circuit.  (This is probably what people think they mean when they talk about ""hardwired control."")  A design using Multiplexers for the combinational logic  A design using Programmable logic arrays (although I don't know if you can even buy these anymore.)  A design where the combinational logic is implemented with a ROM.  (This is probably what people think they mean when they talk about ""microcoded control."")  The ROM might be a EEPROM so that it is somewhat easier to modify if you find a bug.    ROMs can get really huge if you're not careful.  For example a ROM-based design would almost always use $\lceil \log_2 N \rceil$ flip-flops, because making the state wider also makes it sparser, which is sometimes good for gates but not for ROMs.  Also, you would only use the opcode bits as part of the address to the ROM, not the register specifiers and such.  Finally with ROMs you might choose to make the microcode word wide (the microcode word produces the entire set of bits for the control signals) or narrow (the microcode word chooses one of a smaller number of possible control signal combinations and then there's a second ROM that translates from that smaller number to the actual required control signals.  So the distinction between ""hardcoded"" and ""microcoded"" is only one very small decision that needs to be made among hundreds of design decisions.  And it's certainly not the most important one.  (For example, you could choose to put a second bus on the datapath, which would enable you to perform some instructions with a lot less cycles.)  ",1

"Overdrive [SEP] Distortion [SEP] What is the difference between Overdrive and Distortion? [SEP] From a sound design / sound engineer context  As an effect, distortion is any process that alters the sound in the harmonic (tone, timbre) domain.   Overdrive is a type of distortion. It is achieved by saturating (overdriving) the valves in an amplifier (or a simulation of this dynamic).   In that context, overdrive is a subset of distortion.  From a guitar effect / pedal context  From this page:    So what is the difference between a distortion and an overdrive? To put it simply, an overdrive pedal aims at simulating the creamy sound of an overdriven tube amp whereas a distortion does not try to simulate reality and usually offers more gain and is more aggressive.    From the Wikipedia distortion page:    The terms ""distortion"", ""overdrive"" and ""fuzz"" are often used interchangeably, but they have subtle differences in meaning. Overdrive effects are the mildest of the three, producing ""warm"" overtones at quieter volumes and harsher distortion as gain is increased. A ""distortion"" effect produces approximately the same amount of distortion at any volume, and its sound alterations are much more pronounced and intense. A fuzzbox (or ""fuzz box”) alters an audio signal until it is nearly a square wave and adds complex overtones by way of a frequency multiplier.    What is the difference in tone, harmonics, etc.? Are they the same? Which one is better and for what?  The difference is in the distortion amount. Overdrive generates less amount of tone change than distortion. Distortion generates more harmonics and/or the generated harmonics will have more amplitude than overdrive.  Overdrive will be better if you want a cleaner sound, and distortion will be better if you want a more distorted sound.   We can test this by applying both effects to a sine wave and comparing the results. For these tests, I'll use the highest amount of effect possible for each device.  These pics show the device's settings, followed by the harmonic content it induced in the sine wave.

"research assistantship [SEP] teaching assistantship [SEP] What is the difference between research assistantship and teaching assistantship? [SEP] At my university, RAs are paid for 20 hours of nominal work a week, usually through grant funds, to work on a research proejct. TAs are paid for 10 hours per week per course with departmental or university funds to assist the professor of a course. Their duties may include: teaching so-called recitation sections of the course where the week's lecture materials might be reviewed or homework questions discussed or clarified, holding office hours where students can come to ask questions about material they do not understand or get guidance on homework, and marking homework problem sets. TAships generally do not involve doing research with a prof, though students with a TAship may transition to an RA with a professor if they sufficiently impress one during their TAship. The level of pay and benefits is the same (per hour) at my university. Both TAs and RAs are generally restricted to 20 hour per week of nominal work, and health insurance benefits don't kick in until they reach that level.  ",1
"recursive algorithms [SEP] their for-loop counterpart [SEP] Do recursive algorithms generally perform better than their for-loop counterpart? [SEP] I don't think recursive OR for-loop are related to the abstract idea of an algorithm, rather both are a specific strategy to implement an algorithm on a computing system. So your question is basically about which implementation strategy is better for algorithm - recursive or loop based.  The answer (assuming you want to implement the algorithm on general purpose of the shelf CPU) would be for-loop perform better as the recursive call would include the overhead of call stack which will grow for each recursive call.

"two undergraduate degrees [SEP] one master degree [SEP] Are two undergraduate degrees better than one master degree? [SEP] Disclaimer: the following is my practical experience on research. I have no idea about the opinions of admissions committees and the like, but it probably depends greatly on the country and the relative quality of master's and undergrad education.  I am a theoretical physicist by formation (5 years degree). Then I did my master's thesis (I had taken enough courses) in Bioinformatics, and I am doing a PhD in Biophysics.  When I start a new project (or tackle the next sub-project), there are a bunch of things about Biology and Chemistry that I don't know, but most of them are actually quite easy. I am sometimes lacking ""the bigger picture"", being able to my questions into a broader meaning, but that is not so important. For example, my master's project was to improve the number of identified peptides in an experiment using computational techniques, and that is a very clear goal. What to do with this improved results? Obviously, we can improve the things we already do. But, are there biological questions it can help answer? I am not sure, but there are experts on that.  For the middle picture range, I rely on my advisors. They are also physicists, but they have learned along the way pretty much what they need. And after just a few months, I was surprised of how much I was able to help the new members of the lab.  Actually, I believe taking another undergrad degree would not help so much. Of course, I would be faster at the beginning, because I would know what things like ""the $C_\alpha$ residuals"" mean, but the actual meat of the project, where we spend months, is probably not covered (or not covered in enough detail) in most undergrad degrees. And the main reason is that these details are known only to those who have actually worked hands on with it.  Let me give you an example: in Physics we talk about spectra all the time, and all the information you can extract from it, with perhaps, the only limitation is the noise of your instrument. The truth is, unless you have a VERY expensive camera, you are going to find very funny stuff, like two spectra taken right after the other, with exactly the same experimental set up, will not have, on camera, the same intensity; and even the profile of the line. To compensate for this you need to get clever, and it very much depends on the details, so it is very difficult to teach unless your lecturer is an expert in spectra analysis and can tell you how they do it. And still, most people can just rely on the spectra pre-processed by the experts, so they don't need to know this. Unless, of course, you want to work with raw spectra yourself (been there).    Lastly, a master's or a PhD has some courses. They are usually quite specialised, targeted for your level and background, and can bring you up to speed in the things you need to know about your field quite nicely.  And to add some peace of mind, my former lab hired a postdoc coming from computer vision. His biological knowledge had quite big holes, but nevertheless, in a couple of weeks he was already doing amazing stuff with very good ideas.  Bottomline, go for the advanced studies. You can always take Biology or Economy on the side (for example Open University or unofficially at Coursera).  ",3

"a little watering [SEP] no watering [SEP] Is a little watering still better than no watering, when plants are thirsty? [SEP] This would probably depend on the nature of your soil, the type of plants involved, the stage in their development, their drought tolerance and whether it is long- or short-term watering.  In the case of seedlings, for instance, in very warm weather, short-term superficial watering cannot do any damage by causing surface rooting, since their roots haven't yet grown down very far, so a brief watering must be far better than none which would compromise their survival.  On the other hand, if, for example, we take a reasonably drought-resistant and well-established variety of sweet corn, growing in a humus-rich, water-retentive soil before 'cobbing', it might be better to withhold water for a few days, until you can water it thoroughly - unless, of course, we're talking about a 'one-off' or short-term watering. In fact, withholding water for a short time might even encourage the plants to root more deeply and extensively in search of it.  ",1

"a tent on the ground [SEP] its alternatives [SEP] Pros and Cons of a tent on the ground and its alternatives in Namibia [SEP] I would not sleep on the back of your car. You seem to have a single cab. Then the back should be long enough to sleep on. However, the back will become quite dusty. You will be mainly driving on pads, and dispersed dust will lay down on the back.   In your case I would choose between the rooftop tent and the ground tent. The advantage of the rooftop tent is that you rent on site and you leave it there. If you take your own tent, you will have to fit it into your luggage. Maybe you will have to pay an extra allowance for taking it. Thus, if taking the own tent option seems interesting from a financial point of view, don't forget this point.   The disadvantage of the rooftop tent is that you will have to mount and demount it several times a day: demount it in the morning if you do an excursion, mount it again to have a siesta, demount for the evening drive and mount to sleep.    The camping grounds are guarded and very often also fenced (as e.g. in Etosha). The bigger animals are thus kept out.   I would not be bothered about hyenas. Baboons are much more scary. They are clever, insolent and sometimes even aggressive. They are skilled climbers and a rooftop tent won't deter them. Even smaller monkeys, like the vervet monkey, can be a major annoyance. However, in principle you won't find these smaller ones in Namibia.   ",1
"Raw meat [SEP] prepared food [SEP] Raw meat or prepared food? Which lasts longer? - Short term [SEP] As for the cooked meal, it also depends on what else is in there aside from the meat.

It also depends on how you store the meal (aside from storing in the fridge) like wrapping it up in foil, putting it in a closed box, etc.  Overall I trust option B) the prepared meal in the fridge will last longer.   This being because the former raw meat has been cooked or more basically heated above a certain critical temperature for a certain amount of time. This helps to kill bacteria which will otherwise make the meat go bad.  As for option C) Basically frozen food lasts longer than only cooled.

"genre [SEP] style [SEP] What's the difference between genre and style? [SEP] These words are very dependent on the context, and in many cases, they can even be treated as synonyms. That's one reason why you see them being used interchangeably: in case there is no possible confusion, either word can be used.   One way to look at it  I am not completely sure if this is the correct way to look at it, but I've always seen it like this: genre is much more broad than a style. A style can be seen as a subdivision of a genre.  For instance, rock music is a genre. Alternative rock, progressive rock and orchestral rock are styles of rock music.  This is not completely set in stone though, so don't shoot somebody when they say progressive rock is a music genre. :-) You'll see the terms being used interchangeably quite often, simply because their meanings are so closely related.  Another way to look at it:  A ""genre"" is the word for a categorization, so rock music, progressive rock, etc are all genres. Think of a genre as a label.  A ""style"" is what you call a specific element of the music. For instance, David Gilmour's guitar playing style is melodic with lots of string bends.  ",0

"writing lecture notes for an introductory course [SEP] using a textbook [SEP] What is the benefit of writing lecture notes for an introductory course vs using a textbook? [SEP] As someone who's tried to do both, there are some very valid reasons to prepare ""formal"" lecture notes.  The primary reason why you'd want to create your own notes is that for many courses, a single good text is not available, and as a result, the instructor has to cobble together material from a number of different sources to produce a coherent set of lecture notes—or recommend that students work with multiple source texts. (Given the out-of-control nature of textbook prices, the latter alternative is unlikely to work out well.)  If you have a single-text class, it may not be necessary to provide students an additional set of notes, provided your lectures stick to the main text material. However, if you bring in alternative or additional topics into your lectures, you may want to include notes for those topics, and refer students to the textbook for places where you follow the ""standard"" outline.

"from Miami [SEP] Cancún [SEP] Is it cheaper to get to Cuba from Miami or Cancún?

Flights from Miami to Cuba are offered to authorized American    passengers. Try calling Cuba Travel Services (CTS Charters). They    offer daily non-stop flights between Los Angeles and Miami to Cuba.  There are also regular holiday charter flights to resorts such as    Varadero, and these can sometimes be less expensive than those going    to Havana.  Please note that if you have purchased a oneworld ticket then further    flights into America within that year will be disallowed through    American Airlines.    As for what is the cheapest, that's hard to answer as airlines change their prices and can't be answered objectively and accurately as they're subject to change.  In addition, it’s not possible to search for flights on large booking engines (such as Kayak) due to United States travel restrictions.

"start at low end [SEP] high end [SEP] Learning guitar, start at low end or high end? [SEP] Interesting question WSkid. Your question got me thinking, so now I'll try to give an answer that, hopefully, will be useful to you.  I can see your point about playing on the higher end. In fact, most exercises would be easier to do at the higher end, because the frets are spaced closer to each other. However, I think there is a reason why most beginner books/methods start at the lower end. The reason is that beginning at the low end allows the student to learn chords quicker. These beginner books/methods usually want to keep the lessons interesting for a beginner. For most people, it is much more satisfying to be able to play a three chord song then to play scales at the 10-12th frets. Also, its easier for a beginner to apply the things learnt on the lower end (open chord, open scales).  As to the correct method of learning, my answer is: probably a mix of both. Learn open chords at the lower end to give you something fun to play, and practice scales at the upper end to build finger strength and independence, and slowly move the scales to the lower end to increase flexibility and reach. When I first started learning the guitar, I started at the lower end, and gradually learned to move up the fretboard. But had I known what I know now, I probably would have done both.  One more thing, have your guitar checked by more experienced guitarist or a repairman, to make sure the the action on your guitar is not too high. If the action is too high, i.e., the strings are too far away from the frets, it would explain why you find it difficult to to press the lower strings.

"a paper with pedantic vocabularies [SEP] a paper easy to read [SEP] Which is better, a paper with pedantic vocabularies or a paper easy to read? [SEP] There is a third way:  Be pedantic about your vocabulary in the right way to make your paper more readable.  Using established, clear, and consistent vocabulary and defining it when necessary is the best way to ensure that you are not misunderstood. The main advantage of “simple and easy words” is that they do not need to be explained to the reader, but this also entails that you rely on the reader interpreting these words the same way as you do, which may be not given surprisingly often. Defined vocabulary does not have this disadvantage.   Moreover, you need to at least need to mention the established, “pedantic” vocabulary for context and to avoid the impression of reinventing the wheel. By consistently sticking to it, you avoid switching between different terms for the same thing, which usually impedes intelligibility.  However, you should also bear in mind that readers unfamiliar with this vocabulary may want to read your paper. For these readers, define the more uncommon words and cite papers explaining the basic underlying concepts. Papers are not difficult to read because they contain new words, but because these words are not properly explained or because the reader does not understand the concepts represented by them. For example if you write a paper on theoretical particle physics, readers will have to understand some elementary aspects of quantum theory to follow your thoughts. Using vocabulary that can only appeal to readers without this basic understanding of quantum theory is pointless and only raises false expectations.  Finally, if you get to introduce new concepts, you can try to choose words for them appeal to intuition, but this does not mean that you are relieved from the burden of explaining these words.  ",1

"RIA Services [SEP] CSLA [SEP] New Silverlight app. MVVM. RIA Services vs CSLA [SEP] I have recently been working on some line-of-business Silverlight projects.  For one we used straight WCF and did all the CRUD, state tracking, entity relationship, etc. ourselves.  For the second project we are using RIA Services and had it manage all of that stuff for us.  However, we did NOT have RIA Services directly generate services based on our ORM model.  We had a layer of interfaces and ""dumb objects"" in between.  So we had a distinct data tier, business logic tier, and service tier.  RIA Services was only involved at the service tier.  If you are going to use RIA Services, I recommend limiting how much of the layers of your application you let it influence.  It does force you down certain paths as far as design is concerned, so the more you contain it the more flexibility you will have.  This advice is probably sound for CSLA as well.  If you are going to ""bet"" on a particular framework, hedge your bet as much as possible.  In summary, RIA Services will definitely save you time, but it does limit your flexibility a bit compared with raw WCF.  And it has some kinks and weaker areas that still need improvement.  I haven't worked with CSLA, but I have seen Rocky Lhotka give talks on it several times so I know the basics.  It seems like a solid framework.  However, the main disadvantage it will have compared with RIA Services is that it isn't directly from Microsoft, so CSLA won't mesh as cohesively with other MS stuff as much as RIA Services will.  Also, in the long run I'm guessing it will be easier to find people that know RIA Services versus people that know CSLA.  If it helps, I gave a talk on RIA Services you can find the presentation and some sample code on my blog.  [REF]  ",2

"SLF4J [SEP] LOG4J [SEP] SLF4J vs LOG4J Which one to prefer? [SEP] SLF4J is basically an abstraction layer. It is not a logging implementation. It means that if you're writing a library and you use SLF4J, you can give that library to someone else to use and they can choose which logging implementation to use with SLF4J e.g. log4j or the Java logging API. It helps prevent projects from being dependent on lots of logging APIs just because they use libraries that are dependent on them.  So, to summarise: SLF4J does not replace log4j, they work together. It removes the dependency on log4j from your library/app.  Take a look here: [REF] or even here: [REF] (Apache Commons Logging is similar to SLF4J) for more info on this concept.  ",1

"to homestay in Ealing [SEP] a Zone 2 area in London [SEP] Any (dis)advantages to homestay in Ealing as opposed to a Zone 2 area in London? [SEP] Time.    I lived in both Zone 2 and Zone 3 in London (4 years on and off, in Putney, Southfields and Colliers Wood).  Generally (as a guy) I felt safe walking most places in London at night, and on public transport.  Zone 2 doesn't feel safer than zone 3, or less safe.  It's more the certain areas that some people might say to avoid (but that's a different topic).  Zone 2 is not generally considered walking distance to Central London, although it might be, if you're closer to Zone 1 - for example, I've walked to Parliament from Earl's Court easily, but from East Putney I would not be particularly keen - it's a good 25 min on the tube!  From Ealing, you've got a decent way on the tube or bus for every trip.  District or Central line, both will take you into town, and it's convenient for trains out west (overground).  But if you're in town and want to 'pop home' to get something for the evening, it's a fair hike.  It'll totally depend where in Zone 2 the other option is.  As seen on the tube map - Zone two covers an awful lot of suburbs, stations and possibilities.  I'd try and find out where it is.    Of course, the other advantage of having a Zone 3 fare pass (eg buy a Zone 1-3 travel card) is that all your other trips to other Zone 3 locations would be essentially 'free'. And it's not that much more per week.    The other thing to consider is if the tube is down, you'll be taking the bus or overground. So if you know where you're studying (I assume that's why you're there) or where you'll be spending much of your time, play around with the TFL route planner and see how long it might take by bus, train, or tube.  One final small benefit I did notice is that the further you were from Leceister Square (in central London) the cheaper movie tickets seemed to be, so that's a plus ;)  ",2

"quick bread [SEP] cake [SEP] What is the difference between quick bread and cake? [SEP] This question has become blown out of proportion. I was just curious- then I started getting answers that quickbreads and cake are the same thing- which they ""obviously"" aren't. So I started doing my own research.  Wikipedia says that the term quickbread was probably invented in the US after the discovery of chemical leavening. The Wikipedia references and some dictionaries corroborate this definition. Basically anything leavened with soda is quickbread.  This doesn't work. There are a great many things leavened with soda that can't be called quickbread. A good example is plain old white cake. Obviously this is a semantic issue but one that needed solving.  Two American cookbooks that I consider canonical recipe resources, The Joy of Cooking, and the Better Homes and Gardens cookbook, both have a separate quickbread section. In it are a variety of fruit breads as well as some biscuits and scones.  On Food and Cooking muddied the water a bit by differentiating between quick breads such as biscuits and batter breads such as banana bread. These were grouped together, however, and contrasted against cakes. This book says that cakes are higher in fat and sugar and have a more delicate texture.  Ratio, as linked in this answer, confused the terms a bit more also including a term ""quick cake"" but it differentiated between the different products with distinct ratios for the flour, fat, and sugar.  With several competing definitions I decided to take an unscientific poll. I called 6 friends in Washington, Utah, Georgia, and Texas. I tried to find a variety of American cultures. Obviously it is biased by the fact that I know all of them.  When asked ""What is quickbread to you?"" without exception all of them replied ""banana bread""  When I followed up with: ""What is the difference between that and cake"" I received the following answers:    ""It is eaten at breakfast""  ""It has less sugar""  ""It is loaf shaped""  ""It is more dense""  ""It has a more open texture""    My conclusion is that the historical definition of ""anything with soda"" is no longer useful. In cookbooks it seems to now be applied to chemically risen baked goods that:      have as a rule of thumb a particular ratio of flour, fat, and sugar  have less sugar than cake  refers in particular to fruit breads, biscuits, and scones  generally has an irregular vs uniform texture    The popular definition (among my extremely limited, unrandom sampling) adds:    tends to be loaf shaped    And now I can sleep easily again.

"Xponent and Torq [SEP] a Traktor S4 and Traktor Pro 2 [SEP] What are the advantages and disadvantages of Xponent and Torq vs a Traktor S4 and Traktor Pro 2? [SEP] I'll consider you know the basics of DJing and how soft/hardware works in these cases so let's try to split this question:  Xponent VS Traktor S4   The main advantage of the XPONENT is that IT FREAKIN' BLINKS! It has an awesome club presence, just check any youtube video to get that.   The main disadvantage is that it is a piece of crap! Excuse my french but there was a MASSIVE set of Xponents that had cheap ass electric board with cold solders and it would break easily. It seems to be fixed, but I discovered that M-Audio/Avid support is TERRIBLE! So terible that I'm not buying anything from them ever.   Main advantage of the S4: 2 stereo outputs AND a headphone output, while the xponent only has a single stereo out and a headphone output. Oh yeah, it also has a MIC INPUT that Xponent doesn't have.   Mais disadvantage: The jog wheels are small. Really small. I mean, have you tried it? It makes me feel... I dunno, I fell like I'm using an old Behringer or something.   The number of buttons and knobs are almost the same !BUT! if you are into the whole custom scene, the Xponent has a little feature that makes it moar awesome. There's a 1-2 switch in the front that acts as a second controller.   So when you change the switch from 1 to 2 you can then REMAP everything on the controller.   Torq 2 vs Traktor Pro 2  I'm not even talking about Torq 1 since that's no longer supported. Let's talk about Torq 2 vs Traktor Pro 2, it has only a few differences:  Torq 2 has a special crossfade option that adds some effects, it's a cool concept: you can mix 2 songs using a filter, so as you move from one song to the other the filter opens/closes. Their website has a couple of videos on this.   The auto synch across 4 decks feels more right than Traktor, and it works better. This is relevant if you like to change drastically BPMs between songs.   AND torq2 has INCREDIBLE VST SUPPORT. EVEN if the VST crashes the whole software keeps running.   BUT  Traktor is 100% fully customizable. I mean, you can map buttons to change to the library function to select tracks without touching your laptop. If you're into DIY custom midi mapping, this is heaven.   Also, Traktor has multiple EQ choices, Torq2 only has one, so instead of having a Bass/Mid/Tremb eq you can use a Bass/MidBass/MidTremb/Tremb eq.   To be completely honest, I don't have a lot of experience with the S4, I own a Xponent with Torq 2 - (heck I even did some lectures on using Torq and exploring it's functions) - and I would NOT recommend using it. I had a whole lot of problems with support - Torq sometimes decides that it just won't work - the application does not open under any circumstance - and all the seven times this has happened, the only solution was to format my computer. I tried using a Windows XP SP3, Windows XP SP2, Windows 7 32 bits and windows 7 64 Bits. I had problems with all of them.   So, long story short: Avoid M-Audio/Avid for the moment, go for Native Instruments.   BTW: I had some experience with Traktor Pro (I used it for about 6 months), I personally don't like its controls and GUI interface, it fells wrong. But the audio quality, response and amount of customization is beyond awesome.   ",3
"closer to electrical engineering [SEP] software development [SEP] Is embedded programming closer to electrical engineering or software development? [SEP] If you want to be good at working on embedded systems, then yes, you need to think like a EE some of the time.  That is generally when you are writing code to interface with the various peripherals (serial busses like UART, SPI, I2C or USB), 8 and 16-bit timers, clock generators, and ADCs and DACs.  ""Datasheets"" for microcontrollers often run into the hundreds of pages as they describe every bit of every register.  It helps to be able to read a schematic so you can probe a board with an oscilloscope or logic analyzer.  At other times, it is just writing software.  But under tight constraints: often you won't have a formal OS or other framework, and you might have only a few KB of RAM, and maybe 64 KB of program memory.  (These limits are assuming you are programming on smaller 8 or 16-bit micros; if you are working with embedded Linux on a 32-bit processor, you won't have the same memory constraints but you will still have to deal with any custom peripheral hardware that your Linux distro doesn't provide drivers for.)  I have a background in both EE and CS so I enjoy both sides of the coin.  I also do some web programming (mostly PHP), and desktop apps (C# and Delphi), but I've always enjoyed working on embedded projects the most.  ",2

In addition, Professor Y offering to write on your behalf after a one month course says more about her than it does about you.  This does not guarantee that she will write a strong letter, and if she does she may write strong letters for a lot of people, which might be known by the people reading her letters.  Here is my advice.  Go to Professor Y and tell her that you did research with Professor X and published a paper together.  Then, ask her whether you should ask for X's recommendation or hers.

"a line out [SEP] a close mic system [SEP] Advantages/Disadvantages of a line out compared to a close mic system [SEP] The biggest advantage for line out is that you don't have to worry about feedback, and that you can model the tone without worrying about positioning, angles, mics, bleeding, etc; which is a disadvantage of the mic-amp combo, you need to worry about a lot of things to be able to do it correctly.  If you love the sound that comes out of the speakers of the amp, then microphoning the amp has the advantage of capturing the complete tone of the system.  The two deciding factors often are:     Which sound do you like the most, mic-amp or line out?   If you like the mic-amp sound better, will you be able to implement it correctly and successfully? This means no feedbacks, and being able to capture the tone accurately, and making the guitar sound clear in the mix. This also means that you know how to mic an amp: Which mic will you use? In which angle? Pointing to which part of the amp? How close to the amp? You also need to know about feedback, how it's generated, how to avoid it (which also means that you know about PA, monitor, and other sound sources positioning).    The biggest difference between both approaches is the tone. One sounds different than the other. The best guitar amps sound beautiful as a whole (including the speakers) and it's more often than not worth putting a mic on them, but this is not the case for all amps.  So, before anything else, find out which sound you like more with the amps and mics you have available.  Since this has such a big impact in the tone, the guitarist is (normally and ideally) who makes that decision, and if for some reason you can't do what he wants, you do the other option. Seems that you are being able to make that decision, but make sure you take the opinion of the guitarist into consideration. His preference will be reflected in the performance, he will perform better under the conditions he likes the most.  If you liked line out more, just send the out to the mixer (through a DI box and the snake, or directly, depends on your setup).   If you liked the mic sound more, you still have some things to do.   The biggest disadvantage of microphoning an amp live is the danger of generating feedbacks.  You need to be very careful with:     Positioning of both the amp and the mic. Both as isolated as you can from other sound sources (PA, monitoring, other amps). Mic pointing to the amp and away from other sound sources.  Mic type. You need a directional mic (cardioid, supercardioid, hypercardioid) that will reject sound that doesn't come from its front (where the amp is).    Check if you can do these. If you can't, go with line out instead. If the mic will be feedbacking, the mic is just not worth it.  Now check if you can implement the amp microphoning correctly. You will check this during the sound check. Now the whole ensemble will be playing, which will test the positioning of your mic and amp. The mic will now capture other stuff.  Can you hear the guitar clearly in the mix? Maybe there is too much going on acoustically around the mic, and it is affecting the tone (even if there is no feedback). Maybe some things are bleeding into the mic too intensely, and you won't be able to add the guitar comfortably to the mix without affecting other elements. Also, it's easier to generate feedback now than ever. You might be able to solve feedback issues here by EQing the frequencies that are giving problems.  Can the guitar be heard in the mix clearly, without feedback issues, and without negatively affecting other elements in the mix? Then go for it! Otherwise, microphoning an amp will have a negative impact in the performance and sound.   It's not a trivial task, but it's worth the try if you really like the sound of the amp-mic combo. You can always just go line out if you can't pull it off, the important thing is to test first.  ",1

"helper methods as instance [SEP] static [SEP] Which is a better practice - helper methods as instance or static? [SEP] This really depends. If the values your helpers operate on are primitives, then static methods are a good choice, as Péter pointed out.  If they are complex, then SOLID applies, more specifically the S, the I and the D.  Example:  class CookieJar {        function takeCookies(count:Int):Array<Cookie> { ... }        function countCookies():Int { ... }        function ressuplyCookies(cookies:Array<Cookie>        ... // lot of stuff we don't care about now  }    class CookieFan {        function getHunger():Float;        function eatCookies(cookies:Array<Cookie>):Smile { ... }  }    class OurHouse {        var jake:CookieFan;        var jane:CookieFan;        var cookies:CookieJar;        function makeEveryBodyAsHappyAsPossible():Void {             //perform a lot of operations on jake, jane and the cookies        }        public function cookieTime():Void {             makeEveryBodyAsHappyAsPossible();        }  }    This would be about your problem. You can make makeEveryBodyAsHappyAsPossible a static method, that will take in the necessary parameters. Another option is:  interface CookieDistributor {      function distributeCookies(to:Array<CookieFan>):Array<Smile>;  }  class HappynessMaximizingDistributor implements CookieDistributor {      var jar:CookieJar;      function distributeCookies(to:Array<CookieFan>):Array<Smile> {           //put the logic of makeEveryBodyAsHappyAsPossible here      }  }  //and make a change here  class OurHouse {        var jake:CookieFan;        var jane:CookieFan;        var cookies:CookieDistributor;          public function cookieTime():Void {             cookies.distributeCookies([jake, jane]);        }  }    Now OurHouse need not know about the intricacies of cookie distribution rules. It must only now an object, which implements a rule. The implementation is abstracted away into an object, who's sole responsibility is to apply the rule. This object can be tested in isolation. OurHouse can be tested with using a mere mock of the CookieDistributor. And you can easily decide to change cookie distribution rules.  However, take care that you don't overdo it. For example having a complex system of 30 classes act as the implementation of CookieDistributor, where each class merely fulfills a tiny task, doesn't really make sense. My interpretation of the SRP is that it doesn't only dictate that each class may only have one responsibility, but also that a single responsibility should be carried out by a single class.  In the case of primitives or objects you use like primitives (for example objects representing points in space, matrices or something), static helper classes make a lot of sense. If you have the choice, and it really makes sense, then you might actually consider adding a method to the class representing the data, e.g. it's sensible for a Point to have an add method. Again, don't overdo it.  So depending on your problem, there are different ways to go about it.  ",1

"Storing/retrieving images on/from SQL server [SEP] in a directory on server [SEP] Which is better : Storing/retrieving images on/from SQL server or in a directory on server [SEP] I prefer to put binary in the database, but that's primarily because    I know where it is, and I don't need a systems guy to set up a network share or webserver.  I can control who can retrieve the data through my application, rather than rely on permissions on the file system. I can do it on a very granular level very easily.  I get much simpler transactional integrity when inserting files than I would with a file system.    The best argument against database storage are around size - the database might become unmanageable. Much more difficult to do database backups & maintenance; the database is one huge file, whereas if the files are external then you can have some over here and some over there.  If you're using Microsoft, perhaps the best compromise is the FileStream type. It stores the filepath in the database and the files in a folder, but the folder is essentially controlled by SQL. You 'insert' files to the database and they're saved in the folder, and when you 'select' from the database the server will retrieve them from the folder and serve through through the database. In this way you get the best of both worlds - transactions and control, plus the size efficiency of keeping the database small.  ",2

"lighter [SEP] heavier paper [SEP] Should I use lighter or heavier paper for my printed dissertation? [SEP] Lighter paper is usually slightly cheaper. And your finished book would be also lighter (pretty much by definition); this may or may not make a difference for when you carry it to the various offices/libraries as part of the process of finishing your degree.   Heavier paper has a better ""feel"" when you flip pages (think about the difference between a high quality hardcover book versus a cheap paper-back novel). It is a bit more resistant to wear and tear, and if you scan/photocopy pages it will be less likely to have the effect where the ""next"" page shows through.     If the only publicly available copy of your dissertation would be the copy you submit, I would ask you to do would-be readers a favor and use heavier paper. But if you intend to publish your thesis (take chapters and publish them as journal articles, or just put the entire thesis online for the world to see), then the lighter paper will save you a little money, and perhaps be marginally better on the environment.

When/as it breaks down the stuff the tires are made from I guess would wind up in the soil which I can't imagine is good. Also, some chemicals used by some tire manufacturers may leach into the soil.   I did find this one account of health issues from rubber mulch along with this linked report. This other well-referenced document discusses some issues with rubber mulch.  It's still fairly new and I wonder if people are pushing it because they don't know what to do with all these used tires.   Natural mulches feed the soil and increase biodiversity. That's one of the main reasons I use it. I didn't use mulch in the past and I notice a big difference in the soil now compared to years ago.  Some people have an issue with shotgun fungus (aka artillery fungus) with wood mulch. It appears to be more of a problem with wood instead of bark mulches and cedar, redwood and cypress do not appear to be affected because they decompose slower. I believe licorice root mulch is also less prone to shotgun fungus.  I like to use cedar mulch. It's a little more expensive but I like the look and smell plus it lasts longer Every spring I fluff it up and spread it out evenly. Every 2 or 3 years I may need to add a little more. After the first season it turns grey. I don't mind the color but I've been thinking about using mulch dyes.  I really want to switch to compost as mulch Looks like black dyed mulch (which I like) and is even better for the soil. I'm not quite making enough compost to use in the garden yet and have left over for mulch. I might have to buy the initial compost and then hopefully be able to replenish it with what I make.  ",1

"en_US [SEP] en_GB [SEP] Should APIs be in en_US or en_GB or both? [SEP] International APIs  APIs which are intended to be international use EN-US. So if your intent is to provide your API to the developers worldwide (or at least several countries where British English is not commonly used), you should use EN-US.  Local APIs  Of course, small APIs which are targeting precise country can be in the language of this country. But think twice about using EN-GB even in this case:    Living in France, I would personally not appreciate an API en French; English is just easier to use when it comes to development. Locale settings make it just weird to write in local language. If you've seen source code with Chinese, German or Russian names of methods, you'll understand why. What I currently see here too often is the source code which mix French names with accents (é, ê, à, etc.), French names without accents (which is completely wrong and can be misleading), English names, and misspelled English).  Using EN-GB can make it more difficult to use the API even for British developers. It's difficult to remember that we must write Color in C# or in PHP, but Colour in a specific API.  When creating a local API, can you be sure that it will not be famous on international level in one, two or ten years?    ",2

You could check by writing a short C program.  Note that there is one significant difference between shift left and multiplication.

"Shuffling a sorted deck [SEP] sorting a shuffled one [SEP] What's harder: Shuffling a sorted deck or sorting a shuffled one? [SEP] By Landauer's principle, if you want to take a uniform random permutation of $n$ keys to a sorted one, and not keep any bits in the computer which reveal what the uniform random permutation was, you need to erase $log n! \approx n \log_2 n$ bits. This will take $(n \ln n) k T$ energy. On the other hand, the computation taking the sorted array and $n \log_2 n$ random bits to the random array is reversible, and thus the energy expended can be made arbitrarily small.  Note that these are just theoretical lower bounds. The energy currently consumed by these processes on an actual digital computer bears no relation to the above analysis.   ",2

"DFA [SEP] NFA [SEP] Can we say DFA is more efficient than NFA? [SEP] There are two answers, depending on how you define efficient.  Compactness of representation  Telling more with less: NFAs are more efficient.   Converting a DFA to an NFA is straightforward and does not increase the size of the representation.   However, there are regular languages for which the smallest DFA is exponentially bigger than the smallest NFA. A typical example is $(a|b)^*b(a|b)^k$ for $k$ fixed.  Computation  Running it fast: DFAs are more efficient.  The computers we use today are deterministic in nature. That makes them bad at dealing with non-determinism. There are two common ways of dealing deterministically with NFAs: backtracking on one side, which is rather costly, or keeping track of the active states, which means each transition will take up to $N$ times longer (where $N$ is the size of the NFA).

"beer [SEP] wine [SEP] What is more difficult to make: beer or wine? [SEP] I haven't done it myself, but I guess making beer is more difficult for one good reason: safety!  Grapes will ferment by themselves and will produce either wine or vinegar. The fermentation process is violent, so there's no risk. Added meat will be fermented as well!  Beer needs to be sterilized before a yeast is added and there's a risk for butulism.  Now, making a good wine is something else. I guess that making a good wine is far more complicated then making a decent beer, once you overcome the safety issues, as there are a great number of steps involved in making good wine.

"61 un-weighted key keyboard with lots of features [SEP] 76 graded ""soft touch"" key keyboard with minimal features [SEP] Starting piano - which instrument to choose? [SEP] I'm going to answer the general question so that this is not a shopping reccomendation per se (61 un-weighted key keyboard with lots of features vs. 76 graded ""soft touch"" key keyboard with minimal features).  Arguments for a 61 key, unweighted keyboard (PSR-E423 in your case):    This is simple and easy to play, due to the fact that:    There are less keys, and   The keys are completely unweighted (you do not have to develop finger strength to play this).    It has additional fun features beyond being a simple piano.    I know I enjoyed playing with the recording / layering abilities, which are still present in this model (and probably much more advanced now).  There are pre-built ""beats"" / song rhythms for you to play along with, which is great for practicing new techniques or ad-libbing.    The non-piano voices will likely be of higher quality than they are on the other keyboard you mentioned    In my experience, the keyboards with 76 to 88 weighted keys are more focused on the piano sound.  The piano will sound great, the other voices will usually sound kind of cheesy.      Arguments against the 76 key, graded ""soft touch"" keyboard (NP-31 in your case):    It only has 76 keys (rather than a full 88).  While this is more than the other choice, I don't think it's worth the loss of the other features in your case.  It uses graded ""soft touch"" action (rather than the more natural weighted keys).  Once again, this is falling short of a real upgrade, and probably unnecessary for what you're trying to do.  It's not nearly as versatile as the PSR.  All you really get is a piano sound (and probably some less-than-stellar other voices).    Based on the description of what you're looking to do, I would strongly suggest 61 key keyboard with more features.  You are not trying to be a professional pianist, so you don't need something that's going to be like a real piano.  Overall, I think you will get much more use out of this option than the other.  ",2

"airport [SEP] town [SEP] Car rental in Sydney - airport or town? [SEP] Most reputable car hire companies will let you pick up from the airport, although I'm not exactly sure where the pickup point is as I live in Sydney and have never needed to do this.  It is absolutely unnecessary to head into the city center from the airport, so just forget about that.  From the airport you're pretty much heading in the opposite direction from the traffic flow to the city if you are heading west towards Orange, so the likely (not promising) situation is light traffic. You'll be traveling out west on the M5 whereas any morning traffic will be heading east towards the city.  Just be careful not to miss the right hand turn onto the M5, the light set up at the end of Marsh street is a bit dodgy, but once you're on and into the tunnel just keeping heading along the M5. Note this is also a toll road so make sure you have a handful of Aussie coins (currently $3.80 until 24 November, $4.40 after then).  So to answer your question, how far are you from open road? About 5 minutes away.  When I did a Google search it suggested going via Richmond, another option is to go via Katoomba. My uneducated guess is that via Katoomba is more direct, however I can't get Google maps to show me the calculations or the correct route for Katoomba. The problem with going through Bells line of Road (via Richmond) you are a little way from civilization so you may have the odd feeling of being lost every now and then whereas via Katoomba you are driving through towns and can always stop and ask directions.

"Python [SEP] Java [SEP] Python productivity VS Java Productivity [SEP] One of Python's major advantages is its ""batteries included"" philosophy: an extensive and simple to use standard  library. In Java, just reading a text file requires several lines of code, nested readers and such. In Python it's f.read(). This will definitely be a huge productivity boost especially in quick prototyping. Python the language is also generally less verbose, which is not a bad thing (although I think the importance of verbosity vs. conciseness is often overemphasized).  However, if you're already working on some framework, such as GAE, then I would expect the differences to be much smaller, and mainly up to one's personal fluency in the language. You'll be mostly just wiring the framework together with the syntax of your choice, and there Python's great standard library helps little.  ",2

"VIP [SEP] normal sleeper-bus [SEP] What's the difference between VIP and normal sleeper-bus from Vientiane to Pakse? [SEP] I was in SEA at the beginning of the year. Firstly, good on you for not flying south. It's a very expensive and unnecessary flight for a trip that can very easily be made on land.  When it comes to VIP buses in South East Asia, there isn't usually a big difference, but it does depend on the price. Sometimes a VIP bus may give you better seating, A/C, only other tourists/foreigners on the bus and/or it could be faster, as some of the normal sleepers pick up a lot of locals along the way who sit in the aisles.  However, that being said, the VIP buses can be exactly the same. With the trip from Vientiance to Pakse I would probably just get the normal sleeper-bus unless there is a major price difference, which, in that case, probably means the normal is full of locals and will be a less comfortable ride.

"JFK [SEP] EWR [SEP] New York airports: JFK or EWR for brief stopover [SEP] Personally I prefer United to American though American is now trying to get more competitive while trying to merge.  Now here for some pros and cons:  Infant Friendliness  This has been discussed on the forum ad nauseam so I won't repeat this but just refer you to the question asked previously on this forum: US to Asia via Europe with infants  One thing that I would add to the information provided there is that American Airline is now going through Restructuring and a Merger with US Airways, this usually entails layoffs during consolidation, so this always weighs on employees minds, and while they are likely to keep being professional ""Freudian slips"" are more likely to happen.  Also I don't see Alex Cross any more on the list of movies available from United.  Airport Convenience and Professionalism  I can't say anything about the differences in personnel behavior because I haven't found any.  Friendliness is about the same in both(I am yet to find any), but the information is will be provided on what you need and you will be directed to where you need to go.  As far as baggage handling is concerned and speed of clearing border control and customs I would say it's about the same.  Personally I prefer Newark to JFK for location convenience but since you are only planning to stay the night and leave it won't matter much to you.  Quality of Surrounding Hotels  Depends entirely on your price range.  There are hotels like Sheraton, Hilton and Marriott, to Courtyard, DoubleTree, and Hilton Garden, to HoJo, Days Inn and Ramada, to no-name motels like JFK Inn, around both airports, so the choice is yours.  I would suggest picking it ahead of time and making reservations so you won't have to wait at the airport a long time for a pick up by a courtesy shuttle, which hotel normally provides for you.  Hotels around JFK will be slightly more expensive since they are located inside the New York City limits and also will carry higher taxes on the Rooms.  HOTELS AMENDMENT  Since your price range is < $200 total you're probably going to cover most hotels with ease.  Not being in the path of planes landing or taking off would be a little harder especially in JFK where depending on prevailing winds planes can land coming over the city to runway 22R.  So you need to be away from the glide path which means that your choices might be limited to: Days Inn, Best Western, Holiday Inn Express, Comfort Inn, HoJo, JFK Inn, and a couple of others.  Noise situation is better in Newark where hotels except for Marriott are located far enough away from the airport and away from glide paths I have stayed in a Courtyard on Frontage road and in EconoLodge on Route 1 and it's pretty quiet with reasonable prices but you can pick your as choices are plentiful.

"to set up my garden in the fall [SEP] wait until spring [SEP] Would it be better for me to set up my garden in the fall, or wait until spring? [SEP] You could certainly wait until spring and things would probably be fine.  But personally, I'd get going right now with bed preparation.    Till it, clean out the rocks mostly and the weeds and clumps.  The tiller will help break everything into smaller chunks.  To rid yourself of most of those rocks, take a piece of 1/4"" or 1/2"" hardware cloth, nailed to a frame (or not) and use it to separate the rocks from the soil.  I lay the hardware cloth down on a spot in the garden, pick an area of comparable size right next to it and then shovel maybe a couple inches of the topmost soil onto it from that area.  I shake the frame to sift the soil through it and then take the stones and dump them in my wheelbarrow.  Then I put the frame where I just dug and repeat the process, always moving the frame where I just dug and replacing that soil with the newly sifted soil from the next section.  It actually goes by quickly.  If you are in the mood, plant something now and take advantage of the space and the fall weather.  My suggestion?   Bush beans.  They are 50-55 days until harvest generally and so you should be able to get a harvest in before the average first frost date in your area.  I believe you are probably zone 7A like we are here in my neck of the woods.  The beans, by the way, will help the soil by adding nitrogen from the air.  I think the fancy folks call that ""fixing"" the nitrogen.  Regardless, they work well.  Personally, I'd harvest the beans and mow them up right there and let the plants break down in the soil over the winter.  Next, I'd plant a winter cover crop... you could do any number of cover crops like winter rye.  This is a ""green manure"" and it works pretty well.  You just till that stuff into the soil early in the spring before planting.  It adds complexity and organic material your soil - like the bean plants would.  This is, of course, just one way to go.  Come springtime, I'd add compost - your own if you have it.  Vermicompost (worm castings) are great if you have them.  Then, you've got yourself a nice prepared bed and can get things going in the spring without all the bed prep.  Plus, you've got several months of improvement already in place.  Aside:  I generally only till the area the first time and then never bother after that.  I will fork open the soil a bit but I don't run my tiller through it year after year.  I can't see that it really helps things all that much, but that's me.  ",2

"WPF [SEP] WinForms [SEP] WPF vs. WinForms - a Delphi programmer's perspective? [SEP] If you have a Delphi background, you will be disappointed in WinForms. You will try to do things that were easy in the VCL, only to find that they're painfully difficult, or even impossible. WPF will be much less confining.  For example, here are just a few of the WinForms limitations we've run into:    WinForms has nothing that compares to TAction, so if you're used to coding with actions, sharing the same text and icon between a menu item and a toolbar button and a right-click menu, centralizing your enabling logic, and updating the enabled state in the background with OnUpdate... you'll hate WinForms, where you have to do all that the hard and error-prone way.  WinForms' old (.NET 1.0 vintage) MainMenu doesn't support images next to menu items, and the new (introduced in .NET 2.0) MenuStrip is riddled with bugs that Microsoft refuses to fix (because the bugfixes might break backward compatibility).  Many controls, e.g. the TreeView, are woefully underfeatured compared to their VCL counterparts (painfully slow, no owner draw, many customization options missing, etc.)  There's nothing resembling the vibrant community of third-party control developers that you're used to in Delphi. There are quality control libraries out there, but you pay for them -- free offerings like VirtualTreeView just aren't out there for WinForms.    WPF is a little more bare-bones in some respects than WinForms, but it's immensely more extensible.    You want something like TAction? WPF has ICommand, which is just as rich as you're used to (but make sure you read Josh Smith's MVVM article -- normally you have to enable/disable your commands manually when the state changes, but his version automatically fires your enabling code in the background like you're used to with OnUpdate).  You want images on menus? That's built in (and nowhere near as buggy as in WinForms).  WinForms leaves out owner-draw on some important controls, but if you're using WPF instead, you don't need owner-draw -- if you want your TreeView nodes to have black text followed by a blue number in parentheses, you just put it in your DataTemplate and it works, no ugly owner-draw code needed.  You want third-party controls? In many cases, you don't need them, because you can extend what's there in ways WinForms and, yes, VCL developers can only dream about.    WPF has a very steep learning curve, but if you pick up a good book (e.g. ""WPF 4 Unleashed""), it'll help get you over the worst of it -- and you'll be glad to work with a framework that won't hold you back the way WinForms will.

"a Grand Piano [SEP] an Upright Piano [SEP] Is it easier to play on a Grand Piano than an Upright Piano? [SEP] In my experience, it is usually easier to play a grand piano. A grand piano responds better in many ways, for example:    The dynamic scale is bigger. I find it much easier to get a good relaxed fortissimo from a grand.  The notes just ring longer. This makes cantabile playing easier and it's also easier to play slowly.  Combining the previous two, it's easier to separate layers of sound, like background, middle ground, foreground.     (Actually it's often initially easier to separate layers on an upright because the sound is not so rich and thus doesn't get muddy so easily. On a grand you have to do bigger contrasts to get a good sound. The point is, though, that you can make the contrasts big and then the layers really sound differentiated.)  For me, when I've played only on an upright for a long time, this is what takes most time to adjust. The bigger the instrument, the bigger you have to make the contrasts.   This all of course depends a lot on the acoustics of the room, too.    Using the soft pedal on a grand actually makes the sound different (the hammers are hitting fewer strings). So, yet more possible variation in sound.  The action is also different. On a grand the hammers hit the strings from below so gravity plays a bigger role. Perhaps for this reason for me a grand piano often feels heavy while an upright feels stiff. (Another reason might be psychological -- a grand piano has massive sound, thus the action feels massive). I like a heavy action, but hate a stiff one. As for how heavy/stiff, that varies very much between individual pianos. There are both light and heavy uprights and grands.  It's easier to play fast repetitions on a grand piano. Also in general a grand just seems to respond quicker. With the exception of the lowest notes, you can usually get shorter staccatos out of a grand.    This is all assuming that we're comparing instruments which are in similar condition. If course it will be easier to play on a good upright than a bad grand etc.  ",2

Somewhere along the way, primarily in North America, the term ""hibachi"" also started to be used to refer to teppanyaki:    I'm not sure when or why this started; perhaps it has something to do with the fact that Banihana confusingly refers to their teppanyaki restaurants as ""hibachi-style"".  Among these, teppanyaki is most similar to Mongolian barbecue, in which meat is cooked on large, round, cast iron griddles:    (Images taken from Wikipedia.)  If you were to actually go to a Japanese restaurant and cook your own food over a shichirin, it would likely be referred to as ""yakiniku"", which is believed to have some origins in Korean barbecue.  Whereas teppanyaki has been a traditional Japanese cooking method for a long time, ""Mongolian barbecue"" was developed in the 1970s in Taipei, Taiwan.  During that time, Japanese Teppanyaki was very popular in Taiwan, so many people speculate that was actually the inspiration for Mongolian barbecue.  There are also some similarities between the Japanese dish ""jingisukan"" and Mongolian barbecue, however, jingisukan predates Mongolian barbecue.  ",0

"start learning programming - with imperative [SEP] declarative languages [SEP] How to better start learning programming - with imperative or declarative languages? [SEP] I used to teach Prolog as a first language to freshmen (followed by Scheme and Java in the next semesters) . It was great for some of them, and apparently completely impenetrable for many others. Logic programming may be very close to mathematical logic, but many people are not, in fact very good at formal logic - it's very different from the kind of reasoning (largely informal or even unconscious) that people actually use day-to-day.  On the other hand, I have also taught Java first, with much the same ratio of success! These days I believe that it depends way to much on the individual learner to make a blanket suggestion. I still think that starting with near-machine-level languages (to understand what is actually happening in the computer) and then progressing towards more abstract languages was the right way for me personally, but experience has convinced me that this is not the kind of recommendation that can be generalized.

"Unix [SEP] Linux [SEP] What is the difference between Unix and Linux? [SEP] Unix isn't one thing, it's a name for a large family of related operating systems, which share to differing degrees, history and architecture. Solaris, DEC Unix, IRIX, HP-UX are Unix variants. They are to some degree compatible to applications, since they implement POSIX standards to differing degrees, which means they expose similar commands and APIs.  Their kernels are not the same, though if you look up 'unix family tree' you will see a fascinating history of how these variants have evolved from one another, like organisms. That is, a finch and a swallow aren't the same animal but they have much in common.  Linux is a re-write, from scratch, of a Unix-like operating system. Whether programs written for one Unix/Linux versus another is a complex question, but in some cases yes.   ",0
"Big Chicken [SEP] Small Chicken [SEP] Big Chicken vs Small Chicken: weight and stuffing volume ratios [SEP] I think you are over thinking this...  One one hand, the size of the cavity in the chicken is approximately proportional to the width or height of the chicken, and the width is approximately proportional to the cube root of the weight.  However, for small values, the because of the cube law, the volume of the cavity is not going to change by huge amounts--a 2.5 kg chicken will take almost as much stuffing as a 3 kg chicken.   From 2 to 3 kg, you are looking at a ratio of approximately 1.4 versus 1.7, or very approximately 80 percent as much stuffing.  For most cooks, this is in the noise, I would suspect.  However, speaking culinary:    You can simply look at your chicken and estimate the volume of the cavity, or stuff it until it is full--see item 2.  You can bake any excess stuffing separately in a casserole dish.  Or you can bake all of the stuffing (technically, now dressing) in a casserole, which is my preferred method--then the amount you want is directly proportional to the number of guests you have.*  Many folks, including myself, believe roasting the chicken (or turkey) without stuffing leads to better meat, is easier, and the chicken will certainly cook more quickly.  Lots of folks like the stuffing the best, so your guests might want lots.  Leftover stuffing is delicious, and can be frozen.    *Geeks may point out that the guests may have to be weighted by a hunger factor...  ",1
"5400rpm [SEP] 7200rpm [SEP] New Macbook Pro 500gb: 5400rpm vs 7200rpm [SEP] I got the 7200RPM fitted into my MBP (it's about 2-3 months old).

I can't see how a faster drive is going to have a huge impact on games - the graphics card, available memory, processor speed and optical disk speed will all have a bigger impact than the hard drive speed, I would have thought.

"Multi-threading [SEP] Interrupt Handlers [SEP] Multi-threading vs. Interrupt Handlers [SEP] Threads  On a platform that supports multi-threading the threads run in parallel.  That means that multiple threads can run at the same time.  This depends on the numbers of cores the CPU makes available.  If the programmer insists on running more threads than the CPU has cores then the threads will be time-sliced.  How much time each thread gets depends on the priority of that thread.  A thread can also choose to yield, which means that it will transfer execution time to another thread before its time slice is up.  If a thread does not yield the scheduler (which is part of the operating system) will pause the thread and force another thread to run.    Interrupt handler  An interrupt handler interrupts the main program. That means that the state of the thread is saved and execution is paused.  The interrupt handler is executed and when the interrupt handler yields the state of the main program is restored and execution of the main program resumes.    In many systems the interrupt handler is assigned a standard interruption schedule, e.g. 50 times a second.  The interrupt is always given preference over the main program, so if the interrupt takes up a lot of time the main program will get very little or no time to run. The interrupt gets scheduled no matter what. The main program gets whatever time is left over.  An interrupt handler is not subject to a scheduler, although possibly the interrupt can be interrupted by another interrupt.    Time slicing  In contrast, threads (insofar as threads outnumber CPU cores) are time sliced. Every thread gets the same amount of time. If there is a high priority thread it may get more time or get scheduled more often, but the scheduler makes sure every thread does get a time slot now and then.    Interrupts don't play nice  Because an interrupt handler will get prioritized over the main execution it is unwise to treat it like a thread. If you do heavy calculation in an interrupt handler your main program will never run!  This is made worse by the fact that interrupts are usually scheduled to run many times a second.    Alternatives  There is an alternative to abusing the interrupt handler for multi-threading.  You can use fibers on Arduino.  Fibers are cooperative threads, that means that a single thread will run until it yields.  After a yield the next fiber in line will run.  As long as all fibers yield in a cooperative manner this works very much like real pre-emptive threads.  If one fiber does not yield, none of the other fibers will get any running time.  This is the multi-tasking mechanism that was used in Windows 3.x    Just to make things confusing libraries that support this behavior talk about threading, not fibers.  Note that threading is impossible on Arduino, so these misnamed 'threads' are really fibers.    ",1

"male head voice [SEP] falsetto [SEP] What is the difference between male head voice and falsetto? [SEP] Falsetto and chest voice are different mechanisms.  Basically, falsetto stretches the vocal folds by lengthening the distance between their fixtures (the larynx mechanism is a rather complex contraption with various muscle groups changing the overall geometry).  Chest voice, however, also involves tightening the muscles at the base of the vocal folds themselves, so it changes the consistency of the folds, not ""just"" their length.  That makes it comparatively easy to achieve good closure but produces a number of harmonics.  The pure falsetto action, in contrast, leaves the muscles in the folds alone, leading to a rather pure tone (bad for distinguishing vowels, actually).  With practice, one can achieve good closure and a rich tone even with falsetto.  As this requires the ""falsetto configuration"" of the larynx to be close to complete, good closure works best in the high range.  Which means that the use of the full falsetto (rather than a more mixed head voice) works better for natural baritones or basses rather than the rare true tenor.  The larger larynx and larger involved forces make it advisable not to start too early with heavy training: the cartiledge forming the respective mechanism takes decades to fully harden (ossify) after mutation.

"the tenure-track job hunt if you're a professor [SEP] a PhD student [SEP] What are the differences (if any) of the tenure-track job hunt if you're a professor compared to a PhD student [SEP] The difference is that when you are a PhD student, everybody knows you won't be around for long, and everything is (or should be) planned accordingly. You are assigned duties knowing that you will move on relatively soon.  Someone with a more permanent position is assumed to be around for much longer. They can take on longer time duties, and other people may start depending on them actually sticking around.  So, if a faculty moves to another place, some people are likely to get upset. Now, people upset with you across the country is not a big deal; but if you advertise it and fail to get the new position, you will have upset people in your own corridor.  Another factor is that, as soon as faculty announce they are likely to move away, people are going to start dividing up their loot: I'll take half of your lab, because you are leaving anyway; I'll teach your favourite course, because you are leaving anyway; we won't buy you the new equipment because you are leaving anyway... Again, if the deal is off and you have to stay, you have lost part of your lab, teaching, and opportunities for equipment or funding. Note that the second factor is also true for positions on soft money, that understandably, no one should count on them sticking around.

"to return NULL [SEP] empty values from functions/methods [SEP] Is it better to return NULL or empty values from functions/methods where the return value is not present? [SEP] StackOverflow has a good discussion about this exact topic in this Q&A. In the top rated question, kronoz notes:    Returning null is usually the best idea if you intend to indicate that    no data is available.  An empty object implies data has been returned, whereas returning null    clearly indicates that nothing has been returned.  Additionally, returning a null will result in a null exception if you    attempt to access members in the object, which can be useful for    highlighting buggy code - attempting to access a member of nothing    makes no sense. Accessing members of an empty object will not fail    meaning bugs can go undiscovered.    Personally, I like to return empty strings for functions that return strings to minimize the amount of error handling that needs to be put in place. However, you'll need to make sure that the group that your working with will follow the same convention - otherwise the benefits of this decision won't be achieved.  However, as the poster in the SO answer noted, nulls should probably be returned if an object is expected so that there is no doubt about whether data is being returned.  In the end, there's no single best way of doing things. Building a team consensus will ultimately drive your team's best practices.  ",2

"sending paper to a specialized journal [SEP] to a journal with broader audience [SEP] How to decide between sending paper to a specialized journal or to a journal with broader audience? [SEP] I tend to think that in most cases, the specialized/broad dichotomy is not very relevant. The most important point is to send it to an interested editor; if the most relevant editor for a paper happens to be at a general journal, you will often be better of sending your paper there.  I would consider two exceptions to this principle. First, top specialized journals are usually less reputed than top generalist journals, so if you get a truly impressive result, you may want to get the best of it by sending it to a top generalized journal. Second, some generalist journals will turn back papers that seems much more specialized than the average math paper (e.g. when the basic objects you study are unheard of by most mathematicians).  ",1
"to focus on relearning mathematics fundamentals [SEP] learn material as needed [SEP] Is it better to focus on relearning mathematics fundamentals or learn material as needed to understand research papers? [SEP] Why not both?   If you aren't explicitly a mathematician but there is a lot of math used as a tool in your field to solve problems (this is often the case with my field), it is understood that some people are stronger in the math than others. The whole point of having a field where people of different educational backgrounds work together is that you don't have to be an expert at every sub-skill and sub-task - you can have your own unique strengths without starting over at the fundamentals for every subject in play.   A strategy that I've found works very well is read some literature to see what techniques are used by others in their related research. If a technique comes up a few times (like, say, applying Dynamic Time Warping to analyze a time series), read into that bit to get a better high-level understanding of it - how it is used, it's strength and weakness, when it's not appropriate, etc.   At this point you may find that the technique just isn't relevant to your research - so you can probably skip it for now and move on. Sure, you don't understand it from top to bottom - but you just don't have time to learn everything in infinite detail! However, what if the technique seems really useful? Well, some people don't bother to understand it at all and just blindly apply it, because well other researchers have so it's probably fine. I'm not at all fond of this, and I would humbly suggest it leads to bad science, unreliable findings, and missed opportunities.   So if a technique seems useful to you, learn some more about it. Try to delve a little more deeply and find out just what the technique seems to actually do. What do some of the variables mean? How is the calculation performed overall - how does it behave based on some inputs compared to others, and why? Again, you probably have limited time, so don't feel you have to prove everything from first principles.   Next, you still have some time to advance your understanding of the fundamentals. So especially as you read through the literature and useful techniques, what area is really hard for you? Is probability stumping you, or calculus, or dynamic programming, or are the notations and implicit variable meanings alien to you? Reserve a little of your time - perhaps a few hours a week at most - to strengthen yourself on the most fundamental issues. Perform a trivial calculation by hand, or read a textbook explanation of the notations used.   I've found the biggest pitfall is thinking you have to understand everything from square one right at the very beginning, and I have to fight the tendency to get sucked in to minutiae. But then often as little as a few days pass and suddenly I realize I have a far better understanding of something than I thought I did, and it wasn't really as hard as it seemed at first.   Now this works for me, and for plenty of other people I know, but I cannot say it will be the best for you, in your field, with your personality and own unique traits and talents. As always YMMV - find what works best for you!  ",1

In this case, I'm not crazy about the second solution for a few reasons:    There's always a small intellectual burden when defining classes and their relationships. It's not clear what benefit the nested class provides aside from partitioning code. The one class approach is simple and clear.  I'm not crazy about nested public classes.

When I run into this class, it's not immediately clear that it's just a plain old ReadOnlyCollection<LocalFile>. I don't like the extra step of remembering what's behind the curtain.    Additionally, you may want some sort of static method to create your SearchClass. In your example, the class runs processing in the constructor which doesn't allow it to gracefully fail. The only option is to throw an exception. If you use a static method, you have the option of returning null on failure (or some other alternative failure scheme).  ",2

"to ask a question in English [SEP] Japanese [SEP] Is it better to ask a question in English or Japanese if you are expecting a reply in English? [SEP] Asking if someone speaks your language has several potential pitfalls, and even more so in Japan. There are completely different expectations to assess whether oneself actually speaks a language and a portion of fear what kind of expectations the asking person might have if one confirms.  In Japan on top of this, people feel the expectations towards them are much higher than in other countries. while an Italian might hesitate much less to tell you their life story in Italian if you speak only 2-3 words, Japanese have a much higher urge for perfection and rather remain silent as to avoid embarrassment for both of you.  So the best way is normally to try and make the question itself (where is the station?) easiest understandable for the person instead of unintentionally pushing them to a commitment of understanding and being able to reply to you in a foreign language.  So to answer your question, yes they most likely did not want to speak English because, whatever their level of English was, they did not feel that it was enough to confirm that they spoke English.  So if your questions are about a location, knowing the word of that place in Japanese and having a map where people can point to will lead to much better results than asking if they speak English. Asking that in Japanese is even more tricky, specially if your Japanese is not good enough to understand if they would reply in Japanese something along the lines of ""I studied it in school but forgot most of it.""  Regarding getting an answer in Japan to such a question, there is another dimension: People in Japan will not tell you if they do not know the answer. To admit straight away ""I do not know"" is a no-go on several cultural levels in Japan. It would embarrass both of you at the same time from the point of view of the answering person. So unless the person knows the answer, they will most likely start to think silently, tilt their head and make comments like ""So desu nee..."", ""Chotto..."" and pull in air through their teeth. This should be for you the signal not to insist, say thank you and to continue. If you persist, there is a high chance that the person will feel pressured sending you in whatever direction. Please see also my answer here for more details on that topic.  ",1
"a grand piano [SEP] an upright piano [SEP] Why is a grand piano better than an upright piano? [SEP] It's all about the size, and therefore the length of the strings and the size of the vibrating surface of the wooden soundboard.  Even a baby grand at ~5 feet is longer than a typical upright is tall. A concert grand at 7-10 feet is much, much longer.  I can't do any better than what Wikipedia says, so I'm going to quote wholesale:    All else being equal, longer pianos with longer strings have larger, richer sound and lower inharmonicity of the strings. Inharmonicity is the degree to which the frequencies of overtones (known as partials or harmonics) sound sharp relative to whole multiples of the fundamental frequency. This results from the piano's considerable string stiffness; as a struck string decays its harmonics vibrate, not from their termination, but from a point very slightly toward the center (or more flexible part) of the string. The higher the partial, the further sharp it runs. Pianos with shorter and thicker string (i.e. small pianos with short string scales) have more inharmonicity. The greater the inharmonicity, the more the ear perceives it as harshness of tone.  Inharmonicity requires that octaves be stretched, or tuned to a lower octave's corresponding sharp overtone rather than to a theoretically correct octave. If octaves are not stretched, single octaves sound in tune, but double—and notably triple—octaves are unacceptably narrow. Stretching a small piano's octaves to match its inherent inharmonicity level creates an imbalance among all the instrument's intervallic relationships, not just its octaves. In a concert grand, however, the octave ""stretch"" retains harmonic balance, even when aligning treble notes to a harmonic produced from three octaves below. This lets close and widespread octaves sound pure, and produces virtually beatless perfect fifths. This gives the concert grand a brilliant, singing and sustaining tone quality—one of the principal reasons that full-size grands are used in the concert hall. Smaller grands satisfy the space and cost needs of domestic use.    Really tall uprights do exist, but they're not very common. They are sometimes referred to as upright grands.  Of course, whether inharmonicity is good or bad is purely subjective. That classic ""pub piano"" sound, fits perfectly with some kinds of music. It's the sound of an upright, and probably couldn't be replicated on a concert grand.  ",2

"Nevsehir [SEP] Kayseri Airport [SEP] Getting to Cappadocia: Nevsehir or Kayseri Airport? [SEP]   Your reasoning is correct.   Kayseri + rental car is the most convenient option.     You have much more choice to and from Kayseri: better schedules and better prices, through competition. Moreover, the car rental facilities tend to be better at Kayseri. And it is not that further. Anyway, the drive is a quite relaxed one.     Renting a car is definitely a good idea to explore that region. You will be more flexible. Getting from Göreme to more remote places like Mustafapaşa, Ihlara Valley or Kaymaklı is much easier and quicker with a car than with public transport. And you will be at ease to visit Kayseri. Indeed, if you have the time, stop by for a couple of hours. It's worth it.  An alternative would be to use an airport transfer, pulbic transport when possible and eventually take part in organised trips to the more remote areas or rent a car for that purpose on a daily basis. The organisational effort is however much bigger. You also lose some flexibility and spontaneity.   A last word on the airports. Check carefully if your flight to Kayseri is operated from Istanbul Atatürk Airport (code IST). There is another airport called  Sabiha Gökçen (code SAW). The latter is 50 kilometers from what one would call the city center. And transportation to and from this airport is by far not as straightforward as from Atatürk airport.   ",3

"car/hotel [SEP] MotorHome [SEP] Alaska, from Anchorage to Fairbank, car/hotel vs MotorHome [SEP] It is a common misconception that using a motorhome is cheaper than flying, or even staying in a hotel.    Trust me, when you check the rates at the various motor home rental agencies, it's not.  Cruise America, for example, charges $900 for 10 days, plus a fee for every mile you drive.  And that is before you consider the gas, which at 10mpg, adds up.  Yes, if you already own one, you save, but renting mitigates that.  Is there a fuel calculator for RV travel in USA/Canada? will answer the cost of gas piece. The extra gas (10mpg vs. 30mpg) often has a way of costing about as much as the hotel.   Trent over at the TheSimpleDollar.com once did a cost comparison - and when his site is back up, I'll link to it :)  In the end, the gas and depreciation was a wash over a hotel.  In the end, its going to cost about the same to stay in a motor home or get hotels.  The difference isn't in the cost, but rather the freedom a motor home brings. As a proud and happy RV'er, that alone is worth it.  Alaska in particular has a reputation as being friendly to RVs - the wide open spaces, lack of bridges, etc... actually make driving it fairly common.  Still, the Alaska Highway is notoriously long - ""miles and miles of miles and miles.""  Again, if you're looking for cheap, the time savings of a plane should be factored against the drive.  If you like the drive (and I do), do the drive - but don't think of it as a magic way to save money.  ",3
"C++ [SEP] D [SEP] What does C++ do better than D? [SEP] Most of the things C++ ""does"" better than D are meta things: C++ has better compilers, better tools, more mature libraries, more bindings, more experts, more tutorials etc.  Basically it has more and better of all the external things that you would expect from a more mature language. This is inarguable.  As for the language itself, there are a few things that C++ does better than D in my opinion. There's probably more, but here's a few that I can list off the top of my head:  C++ has a better thought out type system  There are quite a few problems with the type system in D at the moment, which appear to be oversights in the design. For example, it is currently impossible to copy a const struct to a non-const struct if the struct contains class object references or pointers due to the transitivity of const and the way postblit constructors work on value types. Andrei says he knows how to solve this, but didn't give any details. The problem is certainly fixable (introducing C++-style copy constructors would be one fix), but it is a major problem in language at present.  Another problem that has bugged me is the lack of logical const (i.e. no mutable like in C++). This is great for writing thread-safe code, but makes it difficult (impossible?) to do lazy intialisation within const objects (think of a const 'get' function which constructs and caches the returned value on first call).  Finally, given these existing problems, I'm worried about how the rest of the type system (pure, shared, etc.) will interact with everything else in the language once they are put to use. The standard library (Phobos) currently makes very little use of D's advanced type system, so I think it is reasonable the question whether it will hold up under stress. I am skeptical, but optimistic.  Note that C++ has some type system warts (e.g. non-transitive const, requiring iterator as well as const_iterator) that make it quite ugly, but while C++'s type system is a little wrong at parts, it doesn't stop you from getting work done like D's sometimes does.  Edit: To clarify, I believe that C++ has a better thought out type system -- not necessarily a better one -- if that makes sense. Essentially, in D I feel that there is a risk involved in using all aspects of its type system that isn't present in C++.  D is sometimes a little too convenient  One criticism that you often hear of C++ is that it hides some low-level issues from you e.g. simple assignments like a = b; could be doing many things like calling conversion operators, calling overload assignment operators etc., which can be difficult to see from the code. Some people like this, some people don't. Either way, in D it is worse (better?) due to things like opDispatch, @property, opApply, lazy which have the potential to change innocent looking code into things that you don't expect.  I don't think this is a big issue personally, but some might find this off-putting.  D requires garbage-collection  This could be seen as controversial because it is possible to run D without the GC. However, just because it is possible doesn't mean it is practical. Without a GC, you lose a lot of D's features, and using the standard library would be like walking in a minefield (who knows which functions allocate memory?). Personally, I think it is totally impractical to use D without a GC, and if you aren't a fan of GCs (like I am) then this can be quite off-putting.  Naive array definitions in D allocate memory  This is a pet peeve of mine:  int[3] a = [1, 2, 3]; // in D, this allocates then copies  int a[3] = {1, 2, 3}; // in C++, this doesn't allocate    Apparently, to avoid the allocation in D, you must do:  static const int[3] staticA = [1, 2, 3]; // in data segment  int[3] a = staticA; // non-allocating copy    These little 'behind your back' allocations are good examples of my previous two points.  Edit: Note that this is a known issue that is being worked on.  Edit: This is now fixed. No allocation takes place.  Conclusion  I've focussed on the negatives of D vs C++ because that's what the question asked, but please don't see this post as a statement that C++ is better than D. I could easily make a larger post of places where D is better than C++. It's up to you to make the decision of which one to use.  ",2

I find that pouring the oil and acid separately creates a salad with a mouthful of olive oil coating the leaves and pool of vinegar at the bottom of the plate.  It's true that the oil in a vinaigrette will eventually wilt the salad but that is why it should be added at the last minute or even after the salads have been portioned.  ,2

"pure horse manure [SEP] bedding manure [SEP] What is the difference between pure horse manure and bedding manure? [SEP] Hmm... well, I don't know the particulars about the straw bedding you've got there but I can tell you the experience here on our farm and what I know about composting horse manure, having done it for the past 10 years or so.  We also compost rabbit, chicken and goat manures here.  Horse manure definitely needs to be composted.  A horse's digestive system is pretty simple and weed seeds can survive it, though I honestly don't see a lot of weeds germinating in our horse and donkey manure.  The manure itself has a good carbon to nitrogen ratio and composts well on its own. Left to its own, it breaks down really well without much other than keeping it moist.  Bedding will generally increase the carbon part of the equation and require additional nitrogen source.  We sometimes add grasses, chicken manure (which is really ""hot"", meaning it's got a high nitrogen content and definitely needs to be composted) and kitchen scraps to it to boost the nitrogen.  Anytime I've got manures mixed with bedding - wood shavings, sawdust or straw, I always ensure that I add a lot of nitrogen to help things move along more quickly.  You can do the lazy composting method - no turning, relying on more anaerobic composting and it'll take longer for both the manure by itself and the manure/bedding to break down or you can engage in what I call my ""farm workout"" by turning the pile to introduce oxygen into the pile and it'll be aerobic and typically break down faster - that's been my experience.  Keeping it moist and turning it often - weekly or a couple times a month might be fine - will speed things up in both cases.  Moisture helps to encourage the decomposition process.  If it dries out, it takes longer, particularly with the bedding.  I don't think my local source of straw uses fungicides and it breaks down reasonably fast.    I try to get my compost bins and piles to contain at least a cubic yard of material as that tends to encourage things to heat up more quickly  but it isn't always possible.  I'd shoot for something in that quantity (or more!) and see how that bedding breaks down.  You might be surprised to see that it does so quickly.  ",1

"to plant a single multigrafted tree [SEP] multiple trees in one hole [SEP] For fruit trees, is it better to plant a single multigrafted tree, or multiple trees in one hole? [SEP] The question is where you want the competition for resources to take place. On multi grafted trees some of the grafts may grow faster due to their position or vigour. I have seen trees like this where one of the grafts fails but you are still getting fruit from the others.  By planting three trees in one hole you are putting the competition for nutrients and water at the root level.  If one fails you still have the others.  These are solutions for gardeners with limited space who have the time and interest to work with trees that are higher maintenance.    If you have lots of space plant one tree of each type at the usual spacing.    If space is at a premium and you don't mind the cost of buying three plants then plant them all in the same planting hole.    If you don't have space or enough money to buy three trees then try one multi graft.    Edit: The advantages of multi graft or multi stem apple trees is that the different types can pollinate each other. If you only have room for one tree or one clump and there are no other apple trees around this is real advantage.  Both types of grafted trees require more skill and time to prune.  You have to ensure that all parts are getting enough light.  A clump of different apple types could get a bit tricky to prune but nothing out of the ordinary.  I don't think the yield of fruit or quality will be any different between the two types so it comes down to space available and price.  ",1

"Smart Pointers inside class [SEP] Normal Pointers with Destructor [SEP] Smart Pointers inside class vs Normal Pointers with Destructor [SEP] No, it's not enough to deal with the raw pointer in the destructor.  You also have to deal with it in the copy constructor and assignment operator functions.  It's usually not enough to simply copy the pointer (which the compiler will happily do for you); you probably really want to make a copy of the resource it points to.  And you have to remember to gracefully handle self-assignment without leaking the resource.  Maybe you don't want to support copying at all, so you have to remember to explicitly disable those functions.  Maybe you want to give out handles to that resource, so you have to keep track of when it's safe to be freed.  What if an exception is thrown in the middle of your constructor?  What if you aren't the one throwing it?  Maybe there's another edge case I haven't thought of.

"polling for events [SEP] using observer pattern [SEP] When would polling for events be better than using observer pattern? [SEP] Imagine you want to get notified about every engine cycle, e.g. to display an RPM measurement to the driver.  Observer pattern: The engine publishes an ""engine cycle"" event to all observers for each cycle. Create a listener that counts events and updates the RPM display.  Polling: The RPM display asks the engine at regular intervals for an engine cycle counter, and updates the RPM display accordingly.  In this case, the observer pattern would probably loose: the engine cycle is a high-frequency, high-priority process, you don't want to delay or stall that process just to update a display. You also don't want to thrash the thread pool with engine cycle events.    PS:  I also use the polling pattern frequently in distributed programming:  Observer pattern: Process A sends a message to process B that says ""each time an event E occurs, send a message to Process A"".  Polling pattern: Process A regularly sends a message to process B that says ""if you event E occured since the last time I've polled, send me a message now"".  The polling pattern produces a bit more network load. But the observer pattern has downsides, too:    If process A crashes, it will never unsubscribe, and process B will try to send notifications to it for all eternity, unless it can reliably detect remote process failures (not an easy thing to do)  If event E is very frequent and/or the notifications carry a lot of data, then process A might get more event notifications than it can handle. With the polling pattern, it can just throttle the polling.  In the observer pattern, high load can cause ""ripples"" through the whole system. If you use blocking sockets, these ripples can go both ways.    ",1

"to publish my academic book traditionally [SEP] self-publish [SEP] What advantages and disadvantages should I consider in deciding whether to publish my academic book traditionally or self-publish? [SEP]   Should I publish it traditionally or self-publish?    Why do you want to publish at all?  You answered    I write the book to store down my research results and to spread my new knowledge. To make money is not the main aim, but it would be nice.    Given that: the answer is that you should certainly not self-publish your work.  You can store your results and spread knowledge by having the material freely available on the internet, as I believe is already the case.  The arxiv is one nice place to put work, but it is not the only one: you could put in on github or any number of other repositories.  You can just put it on your own website and make sure that google indexes it.  That means that billions of people can access it at any time.  Let me be clear with you: you are not going to make money self-publishing works of mathematics that you have not been able to publish traditionally.  It is exceedingly rare for any mathematical text beyond the undergraduate level to make a profit that is worth the time taken to write it.  (Maybe a few of Serge Lang's books qualify; probably not.)  If you go self-publishing rather than traditional publishing, you will lose money, and what you're paying for is the vanity of being a published author.   The bar for interest by the mathematical community is much lower than the bar for the type of public interest needed to generate any real sales.  The thought that you have ""My ideas are too bold for the mathematical community, so I need to take matters into my own hands; they don't know the value of my work as well as I do"" is not only crankish but actually specifically damaging to you: it makes you ideal prey for predators of various kinds.  You told us in a previous question that you literally fell prey to a diploma mill and thereby lost money.  The same mindset that you have now is going to cost you more money in the future.    I'm sorry to tell you this, but this has been going on for several years now, so I feel I should be plain: no one in the world has found your work to be of significant mathematical value.  This means that, with probability slightly less than one, that your work does not have significant mathematical value.  But in the unlikely event that your work does have value, you're not doing what is necessary in order to show it.  Mathematical research is not about simply writing down structures that generalize other structures and proving results about them.  You have to solve old problems or pose new ones that are of interest to the community. Bold statements of superiority would be a positive thing if they are specific and factual: for your work to be ""superior"", it should solve at least one problem that others have posed.  If you've done that, please explain yourself properly and then your work can be published in the mathematical mainstream.  If you haven't: please start to be honest with yourself about the value of your work.  Your livelihood is at stake.  ",2

"mulch [SEP] topsoil [SEP] Is mulch or topsoil better for new lawn in clay soil? [SEP] Not sure where you're from but in the USA you can send a soil sample to your local university extension office and for a nominal fee they will give you a report on the soil that you can use to improve it for your intended purpose. Two key things to look for is the existing organic matter content and cation exchange capacity. This is always a good thing to do before doing major work for a lawn or garden.  When you say ""mulch"" I assume you're talking compost and this is what it's called in your area?  Compost is pretty much the closest thing to a silver bullet when it comes to improving your soil. It can fix all sorts of problems. The only time compost will burn the seed or the seedlings is if it has not been composted properly. This is more of a problem with composted manures which are ""hotter"" or more nutrient rich. A good blend of compost from different sources such as manures, leaves and other plant materials that has been composted completely shouldn't be a problem.  Tilling your soil causes problems but if you need to seriously amend your soil it's the quickest option. A couple of issues are tilling will wind up leaving your lawn uneven and you'll need to fill in areas in the future to level it. Tilling will also bring up a ton of weed seeds that were buried too deep to germinate before so before you plant your grass seed water the soil and give the weeds a couple of weeks to germinate then deal with them before putting down your grass seed.  Clay soil isn't that bad for your lawn as long as you have a decent amount of organic matter already in the soil. You may not want to go to the expensive and effort of tilling in a lot of organic matter (2-6"") into your soil all at once. Another option if your soil has at least 5% organic matter and decent cation exchange capacity you can just top dress with about a 1/4"" layer of compost. This would require 1 cubic yard of compost per 1,000 sq ft. Do this every year for the next 3 years or so and then start doing it less frequently if you are happy with what you're seeing. Time, worms and other organisms will help work it further into the soil.   You should also do a percolation test to see how well the water drains. See:  [REF]  [REF]  ",0

Wikipedia:  Lithium-ion batteries should not be frequently discharged fully and recharged (""deep-cycled""), but this may be necessary after about every 30th recharge to recalibrate any electronic charge monitor (e.g. a battery meter). This allows the monitoring electronics to more accurately estimate battery charge.[26] This has nothing to do with the memory effect.

"advisor [SEP] institution [SEP] What's more important in choosing a PhD program, advisor or institution? [SEP] Obviously one needs a competent advisor with whom one is compatible. But assuming that both professors qualify, I think what matters most is the quality of the students who will be your peers. You need to surround yourself with students who, from day 1, expect nothing less of themselves than to produce novel scientific research of the highest caliber, present it at top meetings, publish it in top journals, and forth. Ultimately you will learn more from your peers than from your advisor. A sufficiently talented and ambitious cohort will hold the bar high for you and push you to excel whereas a sufficiently talentless and unambitious cohort will help you make excuses for your own failures to reach your potential.   In my experience, top schools with top graduate programs have the sorts of students you want to surround yourself with. Second tier regional programs may, but I have yet to see it.   ",1

"a single platform for common services [SEP] modularize them [SEP] Should I use a single platform for common services or modularize them? [SEP] Platform  I like the idea of the platform approach, but there are a couple of points you mention that give me cause for concern.   Why not make the back-end entirely stateless and RESTful? You know, have a bunch of web services that provide the necessary JSON or XML to drive the front end clients. These clients could be written in any language you like, so long as they can consume/produce the necessary intermediate representation. Implementing RESTful web services these days is trivial with JAX-RS implementations like RESTEasy just a Maven dependency away.  Having the platform abstract the database away is good practice simply because you want your client and your services to be as independent of each other as possible.   You mention that updates to the platform would mean taking down the whole system. Why? If you're serious about it, you'll have your live and fail-over clusters running in parallel. You upgrade your fail-over cluster and run your verification test suite on it to ensure it's up to scratch. Then you switch your load balancer to use the fail-over cluster instead of the live one (the live becoming fail-over). If your platform is truly stateless your clients operations will be uninterrupted since the DNS of your services remains the same.  I'd caution against using Java object serialization (e.g. RMI) just because of the binary API restrictions you may encounter if you decide to update the objects.   Modules  Sharing common code between modules is trivial with a build system like Maven (or Ivy if you can't leave Ant). Having a common back-end language will also reduce the learning curve for new developers. Also you'd doubtless have a large collection of template base classes to support common functions in the different back-end layers (DAOs, DTOs, BOs etc). (This is also true of the platform approach).  Given that each module is separate and independent of each other you may find that if developers don't communicate effectively, code duplication will likely occur within modules. Also, bugs will be fixed in one module, but missed in another. This is especially true if you're creating multiple variations of a module to look after different clients.   Obviously, dependency injection and good design will go a long way to mitigate this, but you may find the solution more complex than if you go the platform route.  ",2

"Butane [SEP] propane [SEP] Which torch to buy for finishing sous vide meat? Butane or propane? [SEP] I use Propane all the time.  There are several factors as to why:    It is cheap, about 1/4 the price of butane.    It’s more readily available.  You can buy a propane torch at many different stores for very cheap.    The torches typically put out a lot more heat.  I’ve used both propane and butane, mostly for crème brulee, but other food as well.  The butane torches put out such a focused small area of heat, that it would get uneven burning.  Whereas with Propane, they often put out a much larger area of heat, making it easier to caramelize across the surface evenly.    As for the concern of it imparting propane flavor, I have had that happen, once, but I’ve also had that happen with butane.  It’s all about flow control.  If you have the dial turned up too high and it’s spewing out massive amounts of propane, plus hold the flame too close to the food, you MIGHT get then hint of propane.  But if you have the torched dialed in to the proper settings, you really can’t beat the ease and convenience of “energy-efficient clean-burning propane gas”  ",3

"pink tea [SEP] other types of tea [SEP] What's the difference between pink tea and other types of tea? [SEP] It's hard to know exactly what you're referring to without any context of the event, location, or what you remember it tasting like, so I'll give you my best educated guesses.    If your pink tea sweet and fruity or floral, it was an herbal tea - tisane, and not true tea. (""Tea"" actually refers to the plant whose leaves are used the beverage. Anything that is not made from the tea tree is usually called a tisane.) Some varieties of tisanes that produce a pink liquid include hibiscus, rose petals, rose hips, strawberry.  If the above is not the case, I suspect you're referring to Kashmiri pink tea, sometimes called noon chai.    Disclaimer: I can't find any authoritative sources about Kashmiri online; my knowledge of the subject is anecdotal from my own travels in India as well as stories from people I know who have lived or traveled in South Asia. My understanding is that, like masala chai throughout South Asia, pink tea has some general guidelines but everyone customizes it according to taste or local custom.  The basic distinguishing factors of Kashmiri pink tea compared to a ""regular"" black, green, oolong, or white tea are twofold: color and taste. As you mentioned, this tea is pink in color, which other beverages made from the tea tree are not. The pink color comes from the addition of baking soda. As for taste, pink tea tends to elicit mixed opinions about taste because it is salty; most people around the world typically drink tea unadulterated, or sweetened, but rarely with the addition of salt.  Pink tea shares many ingredients with masala chai, often including some or all of the following:    Ginger  Cardamom   Cinnamon   Peppercorns  Milk or cream   Sugar (or other sweetener)    Unlike masala chai, which is normally prepared with black tea, Kashmiri pink tea uses green or oolong tea leaves.  Ingredients included in Kashmiri chai that are not included in most other chai recipes:    baking soda (just a pinch)  ground pistachios and/or almonds  salt  white poppy seeds    The final major difference is in the method of preparation. Masala chai can be made in a matter of minutes by boiling the water, then adding tea, milk, spices and boiling it all together for a few minutes before straining and serving. Kashmiri chai, on the other hand, takes 1-2 hours to prepare (I believe the long boiling time is required for the baking soda to accomplish its task of turning the tea pink). I don't know the exact process and couldn't find any sources that seemed reliable.  ",0
"Modularity [SEP] Single class simplicity [SEP] Modularity vs Single class simplicity [SEP] One thing that comes to mind is something I just read in Robert Martin's book: You learned design patterns and you learned solid principles. But all these things should not be applied blindly to any and all code just because you know them. Instead, they should be applied when the alternative would be more complicated than not applying them.  It's a pretty good book and he walks you through a bunch of examples of iterative, test drive development. Throughout the book there's a unifying message that says, keep the code simple, don't introduce extra abstraction layers and patterns. Instead, incrementally add features and converge towards known patterns when that proves to be the simplest solution.  Based on your post, it may have sounded like some of your software could have been considered as over-designed. At the same time I do not know what the skill level for the rest of your team is.  And unfortunately, I can easily imagine other people getting confused when they see 2 classes and an interface even if you were absolutely correct in suggesting them.  In my experience, there are definitely some programmers who do still believe that the goal of our job is to stitch together API calls using any number of control statements needed. And when you need to extend the code, you simply need more control statements. And what makes a good programmer is one that can navigate 600-line method and be able to make it 700 lines while introducing only 2 bugs. And if this is what they believe, you will have a very hard time convincing them otherwise, God knows I've tried.  I don't have a good answer for this type of situation.  My only advice would be to gain support of the project technical lead, or another senior developer that others look up to. Have some discussions and reflections on past code and see if you can identify what was done in the past that worked and that didn't. Once you have them on board with you, gain support of management so that the right people would have the capability of ensuring some level of design makes it into the product.  If you don't have that support, I guess you could either a) look for a different job/team or b) create a bubble of good code around you and try to work in isolation :)  Just remember that we apply patterns and SOLID not because we read about it, but because it IS THE SIMPLEST code we can possibly write. So if you practice this stuff, you should be able to code faster and produce higher quality code than your team mates.  Eventually others, including your management, will notice that.  If you find yourself producing ""proper designs"" but your tasks continuously take you twice as long as they would have otherwise, then you may be missing something (good design might take more time upfront, but you should expect to see a payback in very short future).

"tomatoes, then juice [SEP] tomatoes & juice [SEP] Tomato sauce - tomatoes, then juice vs tomatoes & juice [SEP] It doesn't look like it'd make much difference to that recipe. The juice goes in right after the tomatoes, so it's not like they cook on their own significantly. The one thing you get out of adding the tomatoes first is a way to get them spread evenly around the pan without having to stir, so they're mostly on top of the onions and get gentler heat at first. But you'll be stirring soon anyway, so just dumping it all in wouldn't make much difference at all.  ",2

"Medium-quality English conference [SEP] Higher-quality non-English conference [SEP] Medium-quality English conference vs. Higher-quality non-English conference [SEP] Which conference to publish in depends on your goals for the publication:    Conferences can be extremely valuable networking opportunities, and speaking at a conference puts your work in front of the audience of that conference.  If the non-English venue is a community that will be valuable for you to connect with, then publishing there can be extremely helpful with building professional contacts, getting into a good Ph.D. program or getting a good job, etc.  Note that this may apply even if you're planning to study abroad later, as those colleagues may have overseas contacts.  On the other hand, sometimes you are less interested in the interactions at the conference than in just having a ""this is published"" stamp and collecting citations for another line in your C.V.  In this case, it's not the conference itself but the online accessibility of the paper that's likely to be matter more to you, and it will likely to be more valuable to have it in English if your subfield is (like most currently are) English-dominated.

"a dethatching rake [SEP] a regular rake [SEP] Is a dethatching rake significantly better for removing thatch than a regular rake? [SEP] Where in California (according to your SE profile) are you?  Am asking, as from my limited research (knowledge) on grass types used in California, I discovered:    Northern California tends to favour cool season lawns.  Southern California tends to favour warm season lawns.    If you do have a warm season lawn (grass type), for the overall health of your lawn you should only dethatch in Spring, once the grass has woken from dormancy & is actively growing.  Dethatching at any other time of year greatly increases the chance of causing real damage to a warm season lawn.  On the other hand, if you have a cool season lawn (grass type), without a shadow of a doubt the best time of year to treat, perform maintenance, on your lawn is late Summer, early Autumn (Fall). Around ""Labor Day"" in the USA is generally considered about ideal.  Now adding onto ""Mancuniensis"" answer, I recommend paying a visit to your local tool hire shop (store) and rent yourself a mechanically powered Dethatcher (a machine you walk behind, just like a lawnmower) for a ½ or full day.  Additionally, as you paint a picture of a bad thatch problem, I would also be very tempted to get hold of a mechanically powered Aerator and aerate your lawn after dethatching. Doing so will open up the soil, get some much needed air in there.  Then after doing that, I would give your lawn a ""natural"" feed with a allover covering of ½ to 1inch (12.5 to 25mm) thick layer of screened compost (preferably STA-certified or similar).  ",0

"Readability [SEP] minimalism/compactness/conciseness [SEP] Readability vs minimalism/compactness/conciseness in language design: are they antagonistic? [SEP] Conciseness is not the same thing as readability. Nor is verbosity the same thing as unreadability. Readability is a function of expressiveness (how much the syntax communicates), not length. There is often a correlation (up to a point) between conciseness and readability, but don't mistake that for causation.  To the case at hand, the people complaining that the new version lacks readability are most likely rationalizing their irrational fear of change, even positive change. A very large number of languages use similar literals to denote arrays and associative arrays (dictionaries, hashes) without any apparent penalty to expressiveness or readability.  To give you some anecdotal evidence, Ruby is moving from {:a => 2} syntax for hashes to {a: 2} syntax (JSON style). Similar pro/con arguments have been made for similar reasons by detractors but, once people become comfortable with the new syntax, they tend to accept and adopt it without difficulty.  ",1

[SEP] The NEC was IPS based, however I'd say its aged worse then a consumer grade TN panels from the same era - IPS is great, but an IPS with a contrast ratio of just 1:500 means that a lot of the color advantage is lost. Combined with todays higher quality TNs that can produce much better blacks then they could 5 years ago, I'd venture to say that an average consumer would rate a Best Buy 21"" TN as being the ""better"" monitor when it came to looks (though a synthetic test would show the NEC produced more accurate colors).  What all this means in terms of the monitors ""value"" is that you are stuck between todays cheap TNs (sub $200), which for the average consumer look a lot better then your IPS, and todays IPS and PVA panels, which have come down in price by a lot. If someone is interested in accurate color, they're likely going to be a lot more interested in a brand new IPS like this which costs what a consumer TN used to cost, then paying a premium for someones 5 year old, 500:1 screen. About the only market I see is for people who still want 4:3 aspect ratio on a large monitor - at that point you're competing with this (though at this time its known that Dell is playing a lottery with that one - you might get an S-IPS, you might get a S-PVA).

"choose a postdoc [SEP] teaching position [SEP] Should those more interested in research choose a postdoc or teaching position? [SEP] In my discipline, mathematics, there is a huge range of tenure track positions, from very strongly research oriented positions to positions that are entirely oriented towards teaching.  Most new PhD's would prefer to end up in a more research oriented position, but most tenure track faculty positions are not at that end of the spectrum.  This means that a lot of new PhDs will ultimately have to settle for something less than the research oriented position that they have dreamed of.    If you're only willing to accept a research oriented tenure track position and would not accept a teaching oriented position then you should focus your efforts on getting a research oriented post-doc.   If you are most interested in a research oriented position but would at least be willing to consider taking a somewhat more teaching oriented position, then you should make an attempt to get some teaching experience by doing some teaching during your post-doc or by taking a position that is  designed to mix research and teaching. For example, Dartmouth has named instructorships in mathematics with a teaching load of one course per quarter.    There are also non tenure track faculty positions (typically called ""visiting assistant professor."")  These are a good way to get teaching experience but it is extremely difficult to get any research accomplished while teaching a load of 3-4 courses per semester in such a position.  These positions are sometimes created to temporarily fill the vacancy created by when a tenured faculty member leaves or retires.  Sometimes the visiting assistant professor position turns into a tenure track position in that department, but you shouldn't count on this happening.  .    ",1
"Turin [SEP] Genova [SEP] Weekend in Turin or Genova?

Genova has a strong connection with the sea: the wonderful acquarium is considered its main attraction and its internal streets (Carrugi) are quite peculiar too. Even Genova has a rich history and has been one of the major european cities in term of power, so you can find several nice buildings reflecting this.

"hard [SEP] soft [SEP] Suitcases: hard or soft?  Canvas, polycarbonate or something else? [SEP] There is no one right answer for this. Either kind of suitcase could serve you well for this trip.  In my experience, the quality of the workmanship seems much more important than which type of sides your suitcase has in regards to its ability to protect its contents. You'll want strong sturdy zippers with big teeth that won't break easily, nice thick fabric that won't rip easily or sturdy solid sides that can handle impacts without breaking, sturdy pulls on the zippers, wheels that glide easily, handle that telescopes easily, etc. You can tell the quality fairly easily from a physical examination. Looking at a suitcase from a big box retailer vs. somewhere that carries name brands (Samsonite, Liz Taylor, Tommy Hilfiger, etc. etc.) you will notice a large difference in the quality of the materials, and generally, you get what you pay for, however if you have a store that specializes in one off and overstock merchandise from designer brands (sorry, don't know any of the names of places down under to suggest), sometimes you can get a better deal for the quality.  Certainly, there are other features to consider, like whether the suitcase has dividers and zippers to keep clothes separated or organized, or expansion zippers to add space for unexpected souvenirs.   Weight is definitely a consideration, the heavier the suitcase, the less weight left for luggage and the heavier it is lugging it up and down stairs to your lodging, etc. For that same reason, picking a size as large as needed but not larger is helpful too...if you only need a medium roller-bag, don't get a large one! Some suitcases are designed with lighter-weight materials than others. Depending on what you are carrying, if the suitcase is flimsier, you will lose less weight of baggage allowance, but the innards will be less protected. How much protection you need clearly varies considerably by what you pack and how you pack it. Many canvas-like rollerbags have stiff sides on 2-5 of the six sides, so you could pack your more delicate items nearer to the stiff sides, and put more clothes closer to the softer side for adequate protection.   The type of items you describe needing to transport, the protection provided by a regular rollerbag is probably sufficient, and you don't have the excess weight of a totally hard-sided luggage, and as you said, quite versatile! If you're anticipating transporting your scuba gear in this suitcase regularly, I'd probably pick differently because my primary considerations would be different.   PS: perhaps this question would have been better framed as an exhaustive list of the pros and cons of getting hard sided luggage vs a roller bag?  ",1

Game development can be enjoyable, as long as you don't have any aspirations to go up against the big dogs.

"custard [SEP] stew [SEP] Carrot Pie: custard or stew? [SEP] I can see this as being similar to a sweet potato pie.  Best bet in that case would be to cook the carrots, then puree and mix with eggs, milk, etc. just as if it were a sweet potato or pumpkin pie.  Two alternatives that come to mind would be to treat it like a fruit pie, as you say.  Because of the texture of the carrots, I would grate them with the large holes on a box grater, toss with sugar, raisins, some tapioca and whatever spices your heart leads you toward.  An alternative would be to make a molded gelatin like pie, similar to a refrigerator lime pie.  Lots of gelatin and grated carrots.  I, personally, wouldn't like it, but I am not fond of jello with carrots in it either.  Happy experimenting.  ",0
"Silverlight [SEP] flash [SEP] What is Silverlight and how is different from flash? Why should I install it? [SEP] Wikipedia on Silverlight:    Microsoft Silverlight is a web application framework with a scope similar to Adobe Flash. Version 2, released in October 2008, brought additional interactivity features and support for .NET languages and development tools.    So basicly, it is a competitor to Flash that uses .NET languages and is more focused on developing interactive web applications, rather than animations and movies.  Currently, Silverlight is only available for Windows and OS X, but there is an open source implementation being developed by the Mono team entitled Moonlight.  ",1
"to book Dutch train tickets online in advance [SEP] to paying on the day [SEP] Is it cheaper to book Dutch train tickets online in advance compared to paying on the day? [SEP] With regular NS trains (intercity's, sprinter's and stoptrains) booking in advance does not give you any discount. If you would travel with a NS HiSpeed train this could be the case, but there's no direct HiSpeed connection between Eindhoven and Amsterdam, so it's irrelevant to your journey.  There's a direct train between Eindhoven and Amsterdam Central Station which would cost you €17.90 one way. If you buy the ticket at the counter, instead of at the machine, you'll have to pay an additional €0.5.  If you're really tight on money you could look for someone who looks like a student and ask politely if you can travel ""together"". 90% off all students has a card which gives them and 3 fellow travellers a 40% reduction on any train journey. Fellow travellers can make use of this system after 09:00 on weekdays, the whole day during weekends and also the whole day during the months July and August.  When I was a student I've had this question asked several times. When a conductor asked the other person why he had a ticket with 40% discount, I would just say that we travelled together, making the discounted ticket valid.  ",1

"to repeat a caption [SEP] reference an identical caption [SEP] Is it better to repeat a caption or reference an identical caption? [SEP] It depends on several factors:    Can you expect readers to read this part of the caption only once and remember everything important for the rest of the reading? Or do you expect that readers need to constantly consult the caption to understand your figure?  Do you expect figures to be read in order? Or is it likely that a reader will look at a later figure in the series first?  How much information does the caption contain? This is not the same as the first point, as not all of this information needs to be important. Also, this is not exactly about length; a short caption with a lot of numbers is worse than a long caption describing straightforward concepts.  Do you need the space used by the repeated captions?    Positive answers to the respective first questions are in favour of referencing.  But why reference at all, unless you need the space? Because redudancy, in particular in technical aspects is annoying and time-consuming for the reader. If a caption references another caption the reader still remembers, this is the quickest way of communicating it. Otherwise the reader has to read the same (usually boring) text again. Moreover, if there is an unneeded redundancy, I would expect that there is a reason for this, e.g., that you changed some details of what is described in the caption. This would usually make me frantically compare the two caption (and thus flipping back and forth).  If you have the space, I suggest a third way that takes the best of both worlds:    Fig 7. 2×167 in 10–200 mM KCl: (a)–(c) as labeled in Fig. 6, namely: (a) shows the reduced intensity for the varied sample conditions with the inset showing a key region. (b) shows how the scale applied to each data as a function of the concentration. (c) shows the time dependence.    This way, all the information is available for the reader who does not remember or has never read the earlier figure’s caption. But the reader who did, knows that the rest of the caption is redundant.  ",0

[SEP] The important bit is who owns bar? If it's unclear, consider if B can live up to it's method name considering the value of Bar. If so, then make it part of B. If not, then make it part of A.  In a real world scenario, you'll generally find methods that fulfill a design responsibility, and helper methods that fulfill implementation steps. Generally, the decision of whether to call an implementation method resides with the API method - which is generally the public method.  public class Control {      public bool IsVisible;      public void Render() {         if (this.IsVisible) {            this.PrepareForRender();         }      }      private void PrepareForRender() {         // just do it.

"Popular proprietary program [SEP] obscure open source substitute [SEP] Popular proprietary program or obscure open source substitute for reproducible research? [SEP] I think there are two kinds of reproducibility:    The ability of someone else to run your code and obtain the same output.  The ability of someone else to write their own code that does the same thing as yours based on your description and on examination of your code (reproduction from scratch).    The second kind of reproducibility is much more convincing, since the main point of scientific reproducibility is to verify correctness of the result.  For science that relies on code, it is usually impossible to include every detail of the code in the paper, so verification requires examination of the code.  If you use proprietary software, your code probably makes use of closed source code, and therefore it cannot be verified or reproduced from scratch.  If you use open source software, then all of the code that your code calls is probably open source, so it can all be verified or reproduced by someone else from scratch.  At present, it is probably true that the first kind of reproducibility is more achievable with proprietary, widely-used software.  I am optimistic that the current trend will lead to open-source software catching up in terms of wide use (consider SAGE, for example).    Addendum, in light of Epigrad's answer below, which I mainly agree with:  The problem with relying on closed-source code isn't that someone else won't know what that closed-source code is expected to do.  The problem is that if you have two closed-source implementations of the same algorithm and they give different results (trust me, they usually will), then you have no way of determining which (if either) is correct.  In other words, closed-source code would be fine for reproducibility if it were bug-free.  But it's not.  ",3

"to resume torrent downloads [SEP] browser downloads [SEP] Why is it seemingly easier to resume torrent downloads than browser downloads? [SEP] The bittorrent protocol was designed to transfer large files out-of-order. It divides files in chunks (pieces in bittorrent terminology), and maintains a map of which participant holds which chunks. One of the elementary commands is for one participant to request a chunk from another participant. If a client crashes or disconnects, it can check which chunks it has already downloaded (the base data includes a cryptographic checksum for each chunk) and request only chunks that it does not already have. I think bittorrent includes a command to request part of a chunk, too, but if worst comes to worst only chunks that have not been fully downloaded need to be re-requested.  The HTTP protocol was designed to transfer mainly small files and to be simple to implement. Its most basic command is to download one file with a minimum of fuss. A simple server may only understand one command, to download a file in full. Hence, if the download is interrupted, there is no choice but to download the whole file again. There is a way for a client to request only part of a file (with the Range: header). Not all servers implement it (because it is not a fundamental feature of HTTP). Web browsers typically don't bother with it (because they are primarily designed to download small files: web pages), but all download managers support it (because they are designed to load large files) and will use it if the server accepts.

"Intercity [SEP] Thalys [SEP] From Brussels to Rotterdam: Intercity or Thalys?

Regarding ticketing, the point goes to the Intercity, as you say correctly.   On the other hand, if you board the Intercity in Brussels you will be sure to have a seat. I have traveled several times on that route and never had an issue with seats. Trains can be packed in the morning rush hours (into Brussels) and in the evening rush hours (out of Brussels). Traveling in Summer (July-August) is an advantage in that respect, as there will be less traffic due to the Summer holidays.   Between Rotterdam and Amsterdam you can also opt for an Intercity Direct or a Sprinter train. The former is faster and more expensive (+ 2.30 EUR) than an IC train, whereas the latter is slower and costs the same as the IC train  ",1
"Writing robust code [SEP] overengineering [SEP] Writing robust code vs. overengineering [SEP]   How do you guys know that you are writing the most robust code    possible without overengineering?    What do you consider robust code? Code that is already future proof and so powerful that it can deal with any situation? Wrong, no one can predict the future! And wrong again, because it'll be a complicated, unmaintainable mess.  I follow various principles: First and foremost YAGNI (yet) and KISS, so I don't write unecessary code. That also effectively prevents overengineering. I refactor the application when extensions are needed. Modern refactoring tools let you quite easily create interfaces and exchange implementations afterwards when you need them.  Then I try to make the code I write as robust as possible, that includes eliminating as many paths the program can take (and also states) as possible and a bit of Spartan programming. A great help are ""atomic"" functions/methods that do not rely on external states or at least don't leave the program in an inconsistend state when they fail. If you do that well, it's also very unlikely that you'll ever end up with spaghetti code and it's a blessing for maintainability, too. Also, in object oriented design, the SOLID principles are a great guide to robust code.  I've really found out that often times you can reduce complexity, for example combinatorial explosions of program paths or states, by deeply thinking about how you could design it as the straightest path possible. Try to keep the possible combinations at a minimum by choosing the best ordering of your subroutines and designing them for this purpose.  Robust code is most always simple and clean code, but simplicity is a trait that is not always easily achieved. Yet, you should strive for it. Always just write the simplest code possible and only add complexity when you have no other choice.   Simplicity is robust, complexity is fragile.   Complexity kills.  ",2

Your mouth has to work harder to break the strands up into smaller pieces to be more easily swallowed.  If you cut against the grain, you get strands like this:  ||||||||||||||||||||||||  ||||||||||||||||||||||||  ||||||||||||||||||||||||    You can see that the strands are much shorter, which means the meat will fall apart more easily (each strand doesn't have as much surface area to connect to adjacent strands) and will therefore be more tender.

"to use assert [SEP] IllegalArgumentException [SEP] Is it better to use assert or IllegalArgumentException for required method parameters? [SEP] BEWARE!   Assertions are removed at runtime unless you explicitly specify to ""enable assertions"" when compiling your code. Java Assertions are not to be used on production code and should be restricted to private methods (see Exception vs Assertion), since private methods are expected to be known and used only by the developers. Also assert will throw AssertionError which extends Error not Exception, and which normally indicates you have a very abnormal error (like ""OutOfMemoryError"" which is hard to recover from, isn't it?) you are not expected to be able to treat.  Remove the ""enable assertions"" flag, and check with a debugger and you'll see that you will not step on the IllegalArgumentException throw call... since this code has not been compiled (again, when ""ea"" is removed)  It is better to use the second construction for public/protected methods, and if you want something that is done in one line of code, there is at least one way that I know of. I personally use the Spring Framework's Assert class that has a few methods for checking arguments and that throw ""IllegalArgumentException"" on failure. Basically, what you do is:  Assert.notNull(obj, ""object was null"");    ... Which will in fact execute exactly the same code you wrote in your second example. There are a few other useful methods such as hasText, hasLength in there.

"Stock [SEP] Broth [SEP] Stock vs Broth - What's the difference in usage? [SEP] Classification and use of Stocks vs. Broth:  Broths are the result of cooking meat, not just bones. They're generally the result of preparing another item and usually not prepared specifically on their own. The juices poured off from a roasted turkey (after being degreased) would be considered broth.  Whole chickens being poached for another preparation would create broth.  Stocks are made from just the bones. They are prepared specifically for use in other recipes (sauces, soups, stews, rice, etc.)  Stocks are never salted in their preparation or the finished dish will most likely end up too salty due to reduction that will take place upon further cooking. Note that homemade stock will be often a bit more broth-like than restaurant/commercial stocks, since it's really hard to get all the meat off the bones.  Stocks are usually simmered for a very long time (4-6 hours for chicken & 8-12 for veal/beef) to extract maximum flavor and gelatin from the bones.  Broths aren't usually cooked nearly as long due to the fact that cooking the meat for extended periods (even chicken surrounded by the liquid) will result in tough, flavorless meat.  Consomme: a fortified and clarified stock.  The stock is fortified in flavor by the addition of a ""raft"" which is a combination of lean ground meat (appropriate to the type of stock being used) with brunoise (1/16 inch) mirepoix (carrots, onions, celery), and egg whites.  The raft mixture is stirred into the cold stock and as it gently heats, the proteins coagulate forming a ""raft"" on top of the stock.  A small hole is poked in the center (if one hasn't already formed) and as the stock bubbles through the hole it leaches back through the ground meat/egg white raft which filters out impurities to clarify the stock and fortify it with flavor.  Bouillon:  French word for broth.  Court Bouillon: sometimes called a ""short broth"".  A poaching liquid usually used for fish that is usually comprised of water,  acid (lemon juice, vinegar, wine), parsley stems, bay leaves, peppercorns, and some salt.  When to use Stock vs. Broth:  Use stock when a sauce is to be reduced significantly or when clarity of the final result is preferred.  Broths can be substituted for stock when the body of the liquid or clarity isn't important, and when the liquid will be thickened by addition of a starch.  ",1
"Eurail Pass [SEP] Buying Pass on the spot [SEP] What is preferable, Eurail Pass or Buying Pass on the spot? [SEP] A rail pass, like the Eurail, is not always cheaper than buying tickets separately. It depends on your age and on how much and how far you want to travel. If you book in advance you can get more or less important discounts. The drawback is that you have to commit to an itinerary in advance. A pass gives you much more flexibility.

"clear [SEP] opaque tarps [SEP] Are clear or opaque tarps better for solarization? [SEP] Solarization:  It is a practice that can kill most soil organisms, included the good ones. Solarization basically consists in the following:    Release the soil.  Remove big weeds and big rocks.  Irrigate.  Seal the soil with tarps.  Wait a little bit (four to twelve weeks).  Remove the tarp.  Add compost to the solarizated soil in order to restore beneficial organisms.    In the documents linked at the bottom, you can read in detail about the entire procedure. The documents also include some advices for the tarp thickness  How it works?  Tarps allow short wave radation (infrared) to enter. Once light let in and it is reflected by soil: the wave change to a longer one and can not go out (heating the soil). Currently there are some tarps which also let in ultraviolet light (very good for sterilization too).  Transparent tarps or not?  Always transparent. This is because, for example, black tarps will absorb and radiate the solar light back to the air and not inside, so it will heat the soil too, but just by contact with the tarp.  *Thanks to @Laughing_Jack for the correction.

"to accept a single object of a specific type [SEP] an array [SEP] When designing a protocol, is it better for a method to accept a single object of a specific type, or an array? [SEP] There is no general answer to your question, but let me provide one to your example to point out some principles that generally apply.  Note: I shall henceforth speak of ""interfaces"" instead of ""protocols"", not only because it is arguably more common name for it in other languages, but also because I really mean interfaces in a more abstract way, as in ""the definition of how something can be interfaced with"".  When designing an interface, you should design it, as if you had no means to implement it yourself, but rather had to rely on somebody else, whom you will only be able to communicate your needs to through your definition.  If you assume this scenario, you see that you want an interface to be very clear (otherwise the implementation may not be designed to do what you expect) and very easy to implement (otherwise the implementation may fail to do what you expect).   Now in the context where you depend on the service abstracted to the interface you design, you should have been able to make several important decisions, that you shouldn't forward to the implementor to not force them to overstep the single responsibility principle, nor provoke code duplication. Instead, you need to make those decisions and convey them in your method invocation.  In this example, you might have:    figured out, whether some items can be processed in batch - assuming you expect any advantages in doing so   been able to filter out duplicates - assuming your system can produce any in the first place    And thus (under both assumptions) your contract with the implementor should be ""you must be able to process a batch of unique URLs"".   You can hardly transport this contract unambiguously without documentation, but you can try, for example by method names. IMHO receiveDroppedItems is not very expressive, because item is really ambiguous and receive also is in a language based on message passing.  I would call it processDroppedURLs. It's not longer, but it really says what's expected to happen. If I am asked to implement such a method, I think ""Oh, ok, so I am expected to process a collection of dropped URLs"" (assuming I know what dropped means in that context, I know all I need). Even though the collection's type might be defined to something as vague as NSFastEnumeration, I would expect for...in to yield NSURLs. As for the uniqueness information, I would probably rather put that into the documentation, rather than the method name, because it's not that vital.  So to summarize: You want clean, concise, almost minimalistic interfaces with expressive method names, that create abstraction barriers between the current client scope and the abstracted service scope, which are clear and simple from both sides.

"Square [SEP] Round Container [SEP] Blender Buying - Square vs. Round Container [SEP] I can think of two reasons to prefer square containers :    They store in less space for the same volume, when you're dealing with dozens of them (as the smoothie shops likely are)  The key to a good blending is that the inside is not round -- you need baffles and such to keep the blender from forming a single, smooth vortex.  The square containers would help to make baffles more effective by providing larger areas with slower moving liquid away from the center of the vortex.    ",2

As i understand it, i would simply only be able to utiluse ~3,2 GB of them. The rest would just be unsused. Is this correct?    Yes, the extra memory will be physically present, but not usable by a 32-bit OS. It will not cause problems.  ",3
"to book a car rental in advance [SEP] once I'm in South Africa [SEP] Is it better to book a car rental in advance, or once I'm in South Africa? [SEP] It is definitely better to book a car in advance, even in lower season. I would not take the risk of arriving there and not finding a suitable car. Moreover, when you book your car at home you can rent it through a broker. This way you will get a good price. And I have some doubts that you will find a better deal by pounding the rental desks at O.R. Tambo airport.  ",2

"a color video [SEP] a black and white video [SEP] Why does a color video compress better than a black and white video? [SEP] Human eye is very sensitive to luminance change and order of magnitude less sensitive to chrominance change.  MPEG under the hood is based on JPEG transform, so you have 8x8 blocks of DCT.  It blurs a bit the whole block approximating it. Colour space changes to YUV or YCbCr, to encode two channels of colour and one of luminance.  Luminance (grayscale if it was colour) is not compressed as much as new created two colours. These colours are fitted more loosely than luminance.  The most heavy tricks are in colour space and luminance is preserved with lower compression (and less stages).   If you have BW frame it cannot be dealt with high compression as this faster degrades quality. MPEG was not created to deal with BW data. Origins of this codec are from times when grayscale tv was appended colour on top of existing frame.  Here I mean origins, not the same scheme as bandwidth was smaller at this time, I am referring to colour space and compression over chrominance.  MPEG popular scheme is 4:2:2 which encodes four parts of luminance (BW) and two times two colour parts. Colour is encoded as differences, because there are two channels and three colours.  So simply 50% of data is well preserved luminance and 50% are three colours with higher compression ratio. Compressed better means greater ratio of original vs processed channel.  Luminance takes (taking it simple as luminance is part of these colours) roughly equal space as colour info.  Different codecs are using different strategies, I referred to MPEG, not some new mixed schemes.  ",2

"Car rental [SEP] public transport [SEP] Japan: Car rental vs public transport [SEP] In general, you will want to use public transport as much as possible in Japan. Trains travel throughout the country and are clean, punctual and affordable, whereas with cars, driving on highways is very expensive (Tokyo-Osaka is ~US$150 in tolls), driving in urban areas is painful (very narrow roads, expensive parking), and gas is expensive everywhere.    The main exception is if you plan on exploring the deep countryside.  Hokkaido outside Sapporo, in particular, is definitely best explored by car, as are the Japan Alps and rest of Japan's mountainous spine.  The easiest solution is thus to combine the two: take the train out to the general area you want to explore, then rent a car at the station.  JR's Ekiren service (aka ""Trenta"", as in train-rental-car) is the best way to do this, and they often have promotional packages that combine train tickets and rental car.  Unfortunately Ekiren's site is Japanese only, but Japan Experience and ToCoo! offer English wrappers around it, with English roadside support as well.  ",3

If coming off of anything less than two years old, you will notice that when you start up and run things, it will generally be quicker. Anything older than two years and everything will be noticeably quicker.  Between the 920 - 940, I cannot say that you will see any big performance gains. I use many CPUs on a daily basis, and for .5GHZ (within same generations) you really cannot tell many differences  ",1

"Structured programming [SEP] OO programming [SEP] Structured programming versus OO programming [SEP] You might want to go look at this quick video blog.  The upshot is that the difference between structured programming and OO programming is a matter of what they take away from programming, not about what they add.  Software disciplines like Structured Programming and Object Oriented Programming are constraining, not enabling.  Here are some definitions.  Warning: you aren't going to like them.    Structured programming is discipline  imposed upon goto (direct transfer of  control)  OO programming is discipline imposed   upon pointers to functions (indirect   transfer of control)   Functional programming is discipline   imposed upon assignment.  The first is not too hard to understand.  Dijkstra found that it was impossible to create general proofs of correctness when goto was allowed in algorithms.  However if control structures were limited to sequence, selection, and iteration, then proofs of correctness were possible.  Of course we don't even try to prove things correct nowadays, but we do like the simplicity and elegance of structured programming.    It's a little harder to understand OO.  We often define OO as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.  What is lesser knows is that all three of these attributes are achievable, and frequently were achieved in C.  Indeed, C++ started as just a preprocessor that compiled down to C.  It's not actually hard to encapsulate in C.  Nor it is hard to build data structures that are subsets of each other, simulating inheritance.  Polymorphism, however, is a bit harder.  It requires pointers to functions which, in C, are difficult to manage well.  What languages like C++ gave us was discipline imposed upon those pointers to functions.  The C++ compiler built the vtables for us, and initialized the pointers within them according to a strict formalism.  So in a very real sense OO is simply discipline imposed upon indirect transfer of control i.e. pointers to functions.  Structured programming is about how not to use goto.  OO is about how not to use pointers to functions.  And functional programming too is all about what not to do.  In functional programming we do not assign variables except in the most stringently controlled cases.  So in the end, all these  Programming ""technologies"" are actually constraining disciplines rather than enabling technologies.  They tell us what not to do more than they tell us what to do.  And that means that software development has not grown over the last 40 years.  Rather, it has shrunk.  It is become ever more constrained as we have learned all the things we shouldn't do.    Learning what not to do is good; but here's the disturbing question: What new things have we learned to do?  ",1
"Developing With Ruby/Rails [SEP] Developing With PHP/CakePHP [SEP] Developing With Ruby/Rails Easier, Faster Than Developing With PHP/CakePHP? [SEP] Either would be perfectly fine for developing web applications.  If your stronger in PHP than Ruby, then likely Cake would be ""faster"" because you wouldn't have to spend the extra time familiarising yourself with Ruby syntax. Obviously the converse is true.  I don't have a huge amount of experience of either but I'd say I prefer Ruby because I find the libraries easier to use and install (rvm/gems etc) and I like having a local development server rather than using Apache and the large and vocal open-source community on github/blogs/twitter is mostly a good thing.  Really, who cares, they're basically the same: Dynamic scripting language, MVC framework... If you're looking to expand your knowledge you might as well look at something very different like node.js or Haskell and Snap.  ",2
"True Bypass [SEP] Buffered Bypass [SEP] Is True Bypass better than Buffered Bypass? Is it possible to be neither? [SEP] TL;DR  Which is better? That's up to your ears. Both bypasses have trade-offs: True Bypass is the most pure and high-fidelity, but it exposes your signal to long-cable degradation (plus it's more expensive). Pedals with buffered bypass will color your tone (especially if you have many of them), but you can run long cables without worry.  More explanation  True Bypass means that when the pedal is not engaged, your guitar's signal travels directly to the pedal's output along a simple wire. This ensures that the pedal doesn't color the signal, preserving your guitar's tone with the highest possible fidelity. In other words, when the pedal is off, it's as if it's not even there. True Bypass is generally a feature on high-end, boutique pedals, in part because the necessary internal components are more expensive.  Pedal manufactures market True Bypass as the cleanest, most faithful bypass possible. And it is, except for one thing: guitar signals are high impedance. As a consequence, if you run a guitar's signal through a long enough cable, it will start to lose some of the high end. This is why it's hard to find guitar cables longer than about 30 feet, while its easy to find mic cables that are 100 feet or more; mic signals are low impedance and aren't susceptible to signal degradation over long cable lengths.  So if you plug your guitar into a 30-foot cable, plug the cable into a True Bypass pedal, and then plug the pedal into another 30-foot cable before it gets to the amp, the ""bypass is a simple wire"" nature of True Bypass means that when the pedal is off, you've effectively plugged your guitar into a 60-foot cable, and this will have a noticeable effect on your sound. The more True Bypass pedals in your chain, the longer the effective cable length when they're off, and so the more impedance loss your signal will suffer.  Buffered bypass is designed with exactly this scenario in mind. Instead of the bypass being a simple wire, the pedal runs the signal through a small buffering amp first. This solves the impedance issues and ensures that your guitar's signal won't degrade over the long cable length. But while buffering amps are very very clean, they can't possibly be as clean and true as a simple wire, and so your signal is affected, at least somewhat. The more buffered-bypass pedals in your chain, the more buffering amps your signal goes through, and so the more it's affected.  ",1
