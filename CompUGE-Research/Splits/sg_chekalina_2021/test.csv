"Summarize: The Nikon AF-S 80-400mm is slightly lighter and of course better appointed than the Sigma's, although the Sigma was no slouch.
Nikon 10-24 is more useful, better built, faster to focus, easer to manually override AF if needed, sharper and therefore better than Sigma 10-20.
Canon isn't much better, though: They pump out new APS-C bodies faster than most people change their underwear - but their EF-S lenses are completely incompatible with their FF bodies (they don't have a crop mode like Nikon).
Nikon glass will always be superior to Sigma.
I think most people see Sigma cameras and lenses as inferior to brands like Nikon and Canon.
I could imagine if you would want a lighter and smaller option, the Nikon is better than the Sigma.
My Nikon 14mm-24mm zoom, at 14mm, is clearly superior to a Sigma 14mm f2.8 I have and in my opinion, slightly better than my Nikon 14mm f2.8.
1 stop faster than the Nikon and I like the color rendition better than the Sigma 10-20 which I used to have.
I'm sure Nikon can do better than Sigma.
On the one hand you have some who would claim that anything badged as Nikon or Canon is superior to anything badged Sigma.
It definitely focuses faster and works better than a nikon G in low light conditions.
The Sigma has faster autofocus but the Tamron had even better IQ than the Nikon 18-200, what a dilemma .
If they can make it better than there 60mm (which I bought, as it was FAR superior to the nikon macros I tried) it will be well worth the price, and maybe even better than the nikon 105mm .
Sigma 17-70 HSM OS + better range than the 18-55 + faster (but not as fast as the Tamron) + 9"" min focus - macro use + cheaper than Nikon .
The sigma is much faster focusing and better then the Nikon 1.4 g in the center at all of the low apertures.
It did however, focus faster and quieter than my old Nikon 70-200 and was lighter.
The Sigma and Tamron are superior to the Nikon, because .
I believe Sigma 24-105 has better optics than 24-105 Canon kit or 24-120 Nikon, and superior to 24-85 Nikon kit I own.
Build quality is superior to Sigma and Tamron and certainly the same or better than canon and nikon equivalents.
Generally it's slightly better than the Nikon 18-200 but and slightly worse than my huge Nikon 28-70 and 80-200 f2.8 AF-S lenses.","Nikon and Sigma are both well-known brands in the field of photography, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

According to some users, Nikon has superior glass compared to Sigma and has lenses that are more useful, better built, faster to focus, and sharper. Similarly, some argue that Nikon's mm-mm zoom lens is superior to the Sigma mm f. lens. However, others point out that the Sigma has faster autofocus and better optics in some cases. The build quality of Nikon is compared favorably to Sigma.

Some argue that Sigma cameras and lenses are inferior to brands like Nikon and Canon, while some praise Sigma for being cheaper and faster-focusing. Also, some users note that Nikon lenses are lighter and of better quality than Sigma's. There are also comparisons between Sigma and Tamron lenses, with some stating that Tamron has better IQ.

Ultimately, which brand is better depends on personal preferences and priorities. While some argue that Nikon is superior to Sigma in certain aspects, others think that Sigma can outperform Nikon in some situations."

Some praise BMW for its nicer car, superior handling, and more prestige, and also argue that BMW quality is better than expected. However, others say that Honda quality is worse than expected, or that a Honda is inferior to a BMW on a stock basis. BMW's head is also said to be nicer.

On the other hand, some prefer Honda for its simplicity and ease of maintenance, and also state that a Honda is smoother to shift and easier to ride. Honda is also considered more comfortable, maneuverable, and carries its weight better than a BMW in some cases. Other arguments include its faster acceleration and smoother sound. 

Ultimately, the decision of which car brand is better depends on personal preferences and needs. Doing research and reading reviews on specific models can help in making an informed decision."

BMW is often associated with higher prestige and handling better, while some argue that Honda is easier to ride, more comfortable, and carries its weight better. Some argue that BMW has better quality than Honda, while others disagree and say that Honda shifts smoother than BMW. 

In terms of specific models, some argue that the BMW i is nicer than a Honda Accord Touring, while others prefer the Honda Civic, which is modified and faster than their BMW. 

Ultimately, the choice between BMW and Honda may depend on personal preferences and priorities. Some prefer BMW's sound and finer finish, while others find Honda's weight and horsepower suitable for their needs. However, as one user noted, while a Honda may be inferior to a BMW on a stock basis, it is likely to cost less to maintain. "

According to some research, Ibuprofen-arginate (SpedifenÂ®) may reduce pain after dental surgery faster or more effectively than ibuprofen (e.g., MotrinÂ® or AdvilÂ®) alone. This is because it contains the amino acid arginine. However, some users find Advil Liquigels work much better and faster for a headache than regular ibuprofen, and that Advil is preferable to other brands of ibuprofen. Ibuprofen is also advised against for those with a risk for heart disease or stroke. 

Ultimately, personal experience and preference play a role in deciding which pain reliever to choose, with some users finding Aleve or Vioxx to be better than Advil. Others may prefer a less known or cheaper brand, noting that marketing and advertising costs do affect the price of more established brands. 

It is important to note that any pain reliever should be taken carefully and following the recommended dosage. "

An Oracle SQL solution is superior to MySQL for many tasks, yet people are still right to use MySQL because performance is not everything.
He is saying that the data integrity of Oracle and DB2 type RDBMS engines is far superior to MySQL.
I've found that going from Oracle to PostgreSQL is much easier than going from Oracle to MySQL.
It is also believe true that MySQL is faster, more reliable, and easier to use with the right price than Oracle.
Hes using the venerable MySQL for tracking user sessions and e-mail because its ""cheaper and faster and easier to maintain"" than his main Oracle database.
If you can believe many diehard MySQL fans, MySQL is faster, more reliable, and cheaper -- or, simply put, better -- than any other database system (including commercial systems such as Oracle and DB2).
MySQL (or Postgresql which is better) are much simpler to use and configure which makes then better than SQLServer (and if you need a super large site, go with Oracle and save yourself a lot of hassle).
Both of them them were slower than MySQL ISAM but faster than Oracle.
-SQL Server is significantly superior to MySQL, faster than PostgreSQL, and for most businesses is cheaper than Oracle.
To my knowledge MySQL is much faster than Oracle for smaller and simpler database implementations.
When using Ruby on Rails on Oracle I noticed that my database migration tasks are much slower than on MySQL.
It seems that MySQL is simpler than Oracle server.
First, MySQL is significantly faster than PostgresQL and Oracle.","Oracle and MySQL are two popular database management systems (DBMS), and each has its own advantages and drawbacks.

Some argue that Oracle is superior to MySQL, particularly with regards to data integrity and certain SQL tasks. Others claim that MySQL is faster, more reliable and cheaper, and is easier to use and configure. MySQL is also said to be more popular due to its scalability, which makes it easier to throw hardware at problems. Some argue that it is simpler to use and maintain than other DBMS.

However, others point out that both Oracle and MySQL have their preferable use cases depending on the nature of the task. For example, some people say that MySQL is much faster than Oracle for smaller and simpler database implementations, while Oracle is good for large, enterprise-level applications. It is noted that migrating tasks from Oracle to PostgreSQL is easier than from Oracle to MySQL and that SQL Server is significantly superior to MySQL.

Ultimately, the choice between Oracle and MySQL may be dependent on the specific needs and requirements of the user. It is recommended that users do research and read reviews before making a choice."

Some argue that phones can be easier to use for music and have better sound quality than iPods. They may also have a larger and better display. Moreover, phones may have other features such as controlling motors or accessing analog sensor data. 

Others argue that iPods have a smoother user interface and may be faster due to not having to deal with phone processes. Some also argue that iPods are easier to deal with. 

Ultimately, the choice between a phone and an iPod depends on personal preferences and needs. If sound quality and additional features are important, a phone may be more suitable. If ease of use and a smoother user interface are more important, an iPod may be preferable."

Some arguments are made regarding the quality of sports teams from each state. Some people argue that Michigan is better than Missouri in terms of football, and that Michigan State is much better than Missouri, while others argue that Missouri has better SAT scores than Michigan. 

There are also arguments involving geography. For example, Lake Superior is located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, which is known for its beautiful shoreline. 

Moreover, there are historical references mentioning each state. For example, France claimed the Illinois Country, which extended from lakes Michigan and Superior to the Ohio and Missouri rivers, and the Otoe-Missouri Tribe of Oklahoma and the Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa from Michigan sued the state of New York.

The service at J Benjamins is superior to that of the 801 Steak and Chop house.
Much better than steak em up... prices are a little higher but i .
There simply is no objective truth on whether pizza tastes better than steak.
Good luck finding a better steak elsewhere, with a bigger portion size than that.
I chose deli roast beef becase it is a better quality than frozen and formed steak patties.
We ignored his editorial feedback and sauntered around the corner for a middling white pizza and a better-than-expected steak salad at Pitfire Pizza .
I found the selection of food to be a huge bonus, hot burgers, pizza (better than the typical Italian pizza I described above), hot dogs, steak, fantastic pasta, etc.
In the '50s/'60s and into the '70s there were scores of Pasquales, serving good pizza (better than Pizza Hut) and even better sandwiches (the Hoggie, the Stromboli Steak to name the top two).
Nothing tastes better than a farm-raised grilled steak with fresh corn on the cob, garden veggies and berry pie!""
I'm 62 years old and the original P&M Pizza is without a doubt my all-time favorite food - ever, bar none; better than lobster, steak, crab legs, or you name it.","When it comes to food preferences, people often have their own favorite dishes and cravings. 

Some argue that steak is a better option as it is more nutritious, easier to cook, and can be enjoyed in nicer surroundings, whereas others prefer pizza due to its versatility in toppings and flavors. 

Steak can be a healthier option with its protein content, but it's more expensive than pizza. On the other hand, pizza is a more affordable and convenient dish to have for a quick meal. 

Ultimately, the preference between steak and pizza is subjective and depends on personal taste and circumstances. Some people may enjoy having both or even combine them in creative ways. "

Individual models also have their own strengths and weaknesses. For example, some say that the Ford Fusion is slower than the Chrysler Charger and that the Ford Windstar is inferior to the DC minivan. Specific features like OEM cruise controls may also be different between the two brands. 

Ultimately, the choice between Ford and Chrysler depends on personal preferences and needs. Some may prefer the workmanship and quality of Chrysler products, while others may find Ford more maneuverable. It's important to do research on specific models to determine which one best fits your individual needs. "

The Charger was marginally quicker to 160km/h than the Ford, at which speed the Ford would begin to pull past the Charger.","Ford and Chrysler are two American car manufacturers known for their history and contribution to the industry. Opinions on which one is better are divided based on personal preferences and experiences.

Some argue that Ford has never been better and is superior to any GM or Chrysler product, had better quality, and is showing much better reliability now than GM and Chrysler. Others point out flaws in Ford products, such as having a terrible turning radius, inferior OEM cruise controls compared to Chrysler, and worse steering/handling than Chrysler.

Likewise, some argue that Chrysler has superior quality and workmanship compared to Ford or GM. And other opinion pieces simply state that Chrysler is worse than Ford. Meanwhile, some critiques of Chrysler vehicles include them being inferior to GM or Ford, having worse drum brakes than Ford, and in one particular instance, the Dodge Caravan being far superior to the Ford Windstar in terms of performance.

It's important to note that opinions on which car manufacturer is better are subjective and rely on multiple factors such as the specific model, year, and individual experiences. It's recommended to do thorough research before making a decision."

However, that's almost 10 MBps slower than the Intel 80GB SSD managed on the HP EliteBook 6930p.
Intel, for its part, wanted the sexiness of being associated with a cooler brand than Dell, Lenovo, etc. .
Cramer likes Intel ( INTC - Get Report ) and Microsoft ( MSFT - Get Report ) better than Dell.
(There's no appreciable difference in specs that I can find, though this may change once better Intel processors come out (the 1520 uses a different socket type.))
I've read some reviews of the 1521 and there's been complaints about the AMD processor being slower than the Intel Core 2 Duo which comes in the 1520.
Techincially, if you wanted to go intel, you'd also have a better deal building than buying dell.
Intel, in theory, is in a much better position to rebound from declining PC sales than Dell is.
This means the Inspiron 17R is 14 percent slower than our baseline model, which sports a second-generation Intel i5 desktop processor and 8GB of RAM.
So, for Â£50 more than the entry-level Dell XPS 13, you get faster RAM, a quicker processor built on more modern technology and better graphics (Intel 4000 on the Mac, as opposed to 3000 on the Dell).
Please - up till recently the AMD units have been quicker and cooler & used less power than intel chips.
This is significantly smoother than the AMD FirePro M4100-powered ZBook 14 (26 fps) and a bit better than the 40 fps output of the M3800 (using Intel Graphics 4600 and Nvidia Quadro K1100M).
The Studio 14z has a better keyboard, it's tons faster than any Intel Atom system, it can play games, and it still delivers reasonable battery life.

Nope, in fact the ones Dell uses are a little better than the Intel model.
In the gaming benchmark, the slowest AMD 3800 x 2 was faster than the Intel EE840.
The Quadro NVS graphic, for occasional 3D applications, is superior to the integrated Intel chip, though.
the fact is amd makes great products in which many of them are superior to intel.
I doubt that Bay Trail will be faster than Intel Celeron Haswell... .","Intel and Dell are two well-known companies in the computer industry, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. 

Some arguments state that Intel processors are faster than their Dell counterparts, making Intel a better buy than Dell.

This means the Inspiron 17R is 14 percent slower than our baseline model, which sports a second-generation Intel i5 desktop processor and 8GB of RAM.
So, for Â£50 more than the entry-level Dell XPS 13, you get faster RAM, a quicker processor built on more modern technology and better graphics (Intel 4000 on the Mac, as opposed to 3000 on the Dell).
Please - up till recently the AMD units have been quicker and cooler & used less power than intel chips.
This is significantly smoother than the AMD FirePro M4100-powered ZBook 14 (26 fps) and a bit better than the 40 fps output of the M3800 (using Intel Graphics 4600 and Nvidia Quadro K1100M).
The Studio 14z has a better keyboard, it's tons faster than any Intel Atom system, it can play games, and it still delivers reasonable battery life.

I doubt that Bay Trail will be faster than Intel Celeron Haswell... .","Intel and Dell are both well-known brands in the computer industry, but they have some differences in terms of performance and market positioning.

According to some arguments, Intel processors are generally faster than AMD processors used by Dell, and in some cases, a better buy than Dell. It's also noted that Intel has a better reputation than Dell in terms of being associated with a cooler brand and having a better chance of rebounding from declining PC sales. 

However, some also argue that Dell offers better deals for building computers with Intel processors and that some Dell models can perform better than their Intel equivalents. In addition, there are arguments that AMD processors used by Dell can be as good as or even better than Intel processors in terms of speed and power consumption.

Ultimately, the choice of which brand to choose may depend on specific needs and preferences, such as gaming performance, D graphics, battery life, and keyboard quality. It's also recommended to do research on specific models and read reviews to ensure optimal performance and features."

According to users, Objective-C is simpler, with a better syntax, and generally faster than Java. Some argue that Objective-C has a stronger connection with the C++ and Java communities, while others express a preference for the cooler OS X environment that supports Objective-C. 

On the other hand, some argue that Java is a nicer language to work with, easier to read and cleaner than Objective-C, and has a wider spread. Furthermore, Java apps on some platforms, such as Mac, are bulkier and slower than their Objective-C counterparts. 

Ultimately, the choice between Objective-C and Java may depend on personal preferences and the specific needs of the project. It's important to consider factors such as performance, ease of use, community support, and compatibility with the development environment."

Furthermore, some argue that Apple has a more user-friendly interface and design and that using Apple products can provide a better overall experience. Apple's processors are also praised for their low power consumption, providing high performance with good battery life.

Ultimately, the choice between Intel and Apple products depends on personal preferences and needs. Both companies offer different benefits and drawbacks, and it's important to do research and read reviews to make an informed decision."
"Summarize: I installed an 80gb Intel X25-M and am really happy with the results - apps open MUCH faster and OSX boots much quicker than with the original 200gb/5,400rpm offering from Apple/Hitachi.
A second reason: it turns out that Intel chips are faster and better than PowerPC chips after all, despite decades of vehement Apple fanboy arguments to the contrary.
The G4 processor used in the Apple notebooks is inferior to any recent Intel notebook processor.
And no, apple branded SSDs dont count, they're inferior to the offerings from Intel, OCZ, etc. .
Richard goes on to say that the A5 processor is not faster than an Intel processor but instead has a large number of IP blocks that execute different functions with lower power and typically more quickly than a general purpose CPU from ntel.
Apple said it was 10% slower than the Intel processors on this test.
Intel chips are cheaper and faster than what Apple was getting from IBM.
It would just be significantly slower than when run on the Intel machines.
Think that the performance are poor 2-3X Slower than PowerBook G4 under non native intel binaries.
Apple sure can't make it any easier than using normal Intel chipsets.
So, for Â£50 more than the entry-level Dell XPS 13, you get faster RAM, a quicker processor built on more modern technology and better graphics (Intel 4000 on the Mac, as opposed to 3000 on the Dell).
Apple has always maintained the Mac processors, starting with the Motorola 68000s in the original, were technically superior to and much faster than their Intel contemporaries.
For example: All along they were claiming the power pc chips to be faster and better than intel.
The base specifications are a little better than the smaller model, with a faster quad-core, Intel Core i5 CPU and a bit better graphics card: .
This would be alleviated bby making sure that OS X is so screamingly faster and better on Intel than Windows that no one would want to go back.
Unsurprisingly much ado is being made about how this chip makes the new Mac mini X times faster than its predecessor, but then better than the previously Intel GMA 950 graphics chip is hardly cause for celebration.
(9:41pm EST Wed Apr 14 2004) i used to advocate macs as better machines and i still do believe thay are superior to intel/amd.
Apple needs a quad core A7 and iOS 7, otherwise Apple is pulling off the same lie that G4/G5 was superior to Intel & AMD computer cpu's last decade from 2001-2005.
Maybe Apple was a better run company (than say, Commodore), but Macs were not superior computing platforms until OSX met the Intel chip - and that was a long time coming.
Further, when the new wave of ARM-based notebooks arrive, which are much smaller and lighter and cheaper and have much better battery life than Intel systems, they won't have to run FlashPlayer to surf the Web.","Intel and Apple are two well-known technology companies that have played a significant role in shaping the industry. 

Some sources argue that Intel chips are faster and better than those used by Apple, leading to improved overall performance. In fact, some say that Apple's own branded components, such as SSDs, are inferior to those from Intel and other manufacturers. 

However, others argue that Apple's processors, such as the A, excel in low-power usage and run blocks of IP functions more efficiently. Additionally, some argue that Apple's hardware, including quad-core processors and graphics cards, are superior to those of competitors such as Dell. 

There are also mixed opinions on the historical performance comparisons between Apple and Intel. While some have claimed in the past that Apple's processors were technically superior to Intel's, others maintain that OSX only fully realized its potential on Intel chips. Some even speculate about the potential impact of ARM-based notebooks in the future. 

Ultimately, while the choice between Intel and Apple may depend on factors such as individual preferences and specific needs, it is clear that both companies have their strengths and weaknesses in terms of hardware and performance. "

SUVs are generally praised for providing a smoother ride than truck-based SUVs and pickups, having better gas mileage, and offering more comfortable lounging. Some drivers also argue that they feel more comfortable and drive better in an SUV. 

Trucks, on the other hand, are preferred for heavier work, such as hauling boats, cleaning out dog mess, or carrying large cargo. They are generally heavier and more powerful than SUVs and some of them can achieve better performance in off-road conditions or rough terrain. They may, however, be less fuel-efficient than SUVs and provide louder road noise than some of their SUV competitors. 

It is important to note that SUVs have various subcategories, and car-based SUVs may handle better and offer a smoother ride than truck-based SUVs. Additionally, certain SUV models may offer better performance and comfort than others. 

Ultimately, choosing between an SUV and a truck depends on the kind of work or transport you require, as well as your personal preferences."
