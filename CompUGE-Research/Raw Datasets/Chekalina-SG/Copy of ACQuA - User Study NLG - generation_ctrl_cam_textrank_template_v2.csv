0,microsoft,sony,,which next-gen console is the best NITENDO SONYS  PS3 - MICROSOFT XBOX 360?," I am a big fan of Nintendo and their games but i have to say that Sony has done it right with this console. It looks beautiful on my TV and plays all kinds of games. The only thing about it that bothers me is how long it takes for the game to load when you turn it on. Other than that, its great. This was an amazing deal at $199 from Best Buy. My son loves his new PS3. He got one as soon as they were available. We are very happy with our purchase. Thank you. Great deal! Got mine in 2 days after ordering it. No problems so far. Only issue I've had is getting used to the controller layout. It's not quite like any other controller, but I'm sure I'll get over that. Overall great deal. Bought this system last week and it's been great!! Very fast shipping too! Thanks Amazon! I bought this system yesterday and received it today. So far everything works great, no problems. I love it!"," I think that the answer to this question depends on what you mean by “better”. For me, it comes down to two things: 1) how much of a difference does it make in terms of performance and 2) whether or not it’s worth paying more for it. If you’re looking at buying an Xbox One, then yes, I’d say go ahead and get one. But if you’re just thinking about getting one, then no, don’t bother. The only reason why I’m even considering one now is because my 360 has been acting up lately (again, probably due to overheating). And while I’ve had no problems with it, there are definitely things that could be improved upon. So far, though, there’s nothing really compelling me to buy another Xbox. In fact, after playing around with some other consoles over the last few days, I can’t see myself ever wanting to. Maybe I’ll wait until they have something new out before making any decisions. What do you think? Are you planning on picking up an Xbox One? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.","Sony is better than Microsoft. 
 Nintendo have many great IPs.  Would be awesome if they would team up with Sony in the future and act as a software company and release games for the PS.  But it's highly unlikely to happen but you can dream.  Sony is a superior hardware manufacturer, much better than both Nintendo and Microsoft. 
 I use the 360 far more than the PS3, and Sony hasn't shown me anything that will change that trend.  Sony is slower than Microsoft.  PlayStation should've had real life graphics on PS3.  Microsoft is better & 2 times faster than Sony.","Sony is better than microsoft. 
On the one hand:
1) Which is one of the areas that Sony is better than Microsoft. 
2) Apparently, talks with Sony are going better than those with Microsoft. 
3) In my opinion, Sony has had better customer support than Microsoft. 

On the other hand: 
1) Microsoft also has a better Day One lineup than Sony does. 
2) Microsoft: Our first party games are superior to Sony and Nintendo's . 
3) Worse even than Microsoft WMA (Napster et al), in fact: . 
","Sony is better than microsoft.
On the one hand: 
1) Sony is a superior hardware manufacturer, much better than both Nintendo and Microsoft. 
2) When asked why the PS4 is so physically superior to the Xbox One, the simple answer is: Sony is better than Microsoft at designing hardware. 
3) Microsoft is inferior to Sony in terms of gaming.

On the other hand:
1) Microsoft is better & 2 times faster than Sony. 
2) But Microsoft made these updates go much faster, smoother, and less frequent than Sony ever did with the PlayStation 3. 
3) The fact is Microsoft has a much better (easier to use) SDK for games than Sony does.","I would prefer to use sony because it's smarter, faster and stupider. Microsoft is faster, easier to use and easier.","After much thought, I realized that  sony is better, because it's greater and smarter. But it will be useful for you to know that microsoft is quicker to its missteps, quicker and faster."," I think the answer to that question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a tablet with great battery life, good performance, and excellent build quality, then go for Microsoft. But if you prefer something more portable, like an iPad, then Sony has got your back. The Xperia Tablet Z features a 10.1-inch display which makes it one of the best tablets in its price range. It also comes with Android 4.4.2 KitKat out of the box so there will be no need to update it. This means that this device can run all current apps without any problems. You get 4GB RAM along with 32GB internal storage space. There is microSD card slot too but we don’t recommend using it, as it’s not compatible with most cards. We have tested our own 16GB MicroSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 memory card. In terms of specs, the Xperia Tablet Z packs a Snapdragon 800 SoC clocked at 1.5GHz. That gives us plenty of power for running multiple applications simultaneously."," is a bit of an apples to oranges comparison. The only thing I can think that would make it worse for MS is if they were able to get the price down even more. But then again, what do you expect from Microsoft? They are not going to give up on their current business model and go back into making games at full price. @rjejr - It was always about money in my opinion. If we had gotten any sort of support or updates with this game when it first came out, we'd have been happy enough but now it's just another piece of crap that's being shoved out there without much thought behind it. I'm sure some people will enjoy it, but as far as I'm concerned, I'll stick with my original plan which was to wait until all the bugs were worked out. And yes, I've already bought the game. It's still sitting on my shelf collecting dust. @rjejr, I don't know why anyone should be upset by this. This isn't like buying a new car every time something goes wrong."," and the other big two are still in a state of flux. I think that is why we have so many different versions of Windows on various platforms. The only way to get one with all the features you want is to buy multiple copies for each platform. If they were just released as updates then it would be much easier to use them all. But since there are several versions, some people will end up using more than one. It seems like this has been going on forever. In fact, it’s not even new anymore. It’s called “fragmentation”. And while fragmentation may seem bad, when done right, it can actually make your life easier. You don’t need to worry about which version of an app you’re using. Just download whichever version works best for you. This makes things easier, especially if you’ve got kids or pets. So what do you think? Is fragmentation really such a bad thing? Or should developers focus their efforts elsewhere? Let us know your thoughts in the comments."," to make a game that is not only fun but also has some kind of story and character development. I think the reason why this isn't happening more often is because most games are made by companies who don't have any idea what they want their audience to do with their time. They just throw out whatever comes into their head at the time without thinking about how it will affect other people in the long run. This means that there aren't many developers making good games. The ones that exist tend to be small studios which usually work on one project for several years before moving onto something else. It makes sense if you look at the history of video games, where development cycles were much shorter than today. But now we live in an era when every single person working on a new title wants to release as soon as possible. It's hard to find talented programmers these days. So even though it's easy to get a job doing nothing else, there's no incentive to spend your life developing great software.",How can you even ask this question yet? Only the Xbox 360 is out at the moment and that hasn't even been tested by gamers enough to see truely how good or rubbish it is. You need to ask the question again when all three systems are out!,1,"The sony is better than microsoft. 

On the other hand: 
1) they say that microsoft is better because ""this would never happen to them"" but really this just proves that sony is better because they actually came out of this situation quicker than i expected. 
2) Sony will have a harder time than Microsoft, probably because of the Japan-China relations.",1," The Nintendo Wii U was a great system but it didn't have any of its own games so I think that Sony will be able to make some good games. They are very strong in their home consoles and they also sell lots of video game accessories like controllers etc. So if you look at what Microsoft has done with Xbox 360 then it's going to be hard for them to beat them. If you compare Microsoft's hardware against Sony's hardware, there isn't much difference between the two.",, I have a ps3 and i love it but the xbox one has so much more to offer for me as an avid gamer. The controller feels really good in my hands and its not too big or small. It also looks great with all of the new features like voice chat and kinect integration. Also if you are looking at buying this console then go ahead and get it. You will be happy that you did.1 out of 2 people found this review helpful.
1,apple,ibm,,What is the brief summary of the differences and similarities between Apple and IBM?," The short answer is: they are both software companies. They have different business models, but their products are very similar. Both companies make a lot of money selling software. And IBM has been around for longer than Apple. In fact, it was founded in 1899 by Charles Babbage. But there are some key differences. For one, Apple makes its own hardware. It uses chips made inside its computers. IBM, on the other hand, sells computers that run on servers built into them. That means you need to buy your own. You also can’t just plug one computer into another computer. There must be an additional piece of hardware called a server. So if you’re going to build a new computer, it’s not as simple as plugging everything in. It’s more like building two computers, each with its own processor. How do these machines compare when it comes to performance? When I first started working at Apple, we had about 100 people doing all kinds of things. We were making things faster every day. Then we got bigger, so now we’re up to over 10,000 people. We’re still growing fast."," I think that the answer to this question depends on what you mean by “better.” If you’re talking about a more efficient and effective way of doing things, then yes, Apple has been better. But if you’re looking for something that’s just as good but cheaper, well, then, no, it hasn’t been. And it’s not even close. The iPad Pro was an amazing product when it first came out, and it still is. It may have had some minor flaws in its design, like the lack of a headphone jack, or the fact that it didn’t come with any kind of pen support, but those were all relatively small things compared to how much people loved it. It’s hard to imagine anyone being disappointed at all. Now, however, there are two major changes happening within Apple’s tablet lineup. First, there’s the new 10.5-inch iPad, which will be available later this year. This one comes with Retina display technology instead of LCD, so it’ll look great whether you’re reading text or watching video.","Apple is better than ibm. 
 Apple Computer senses the same thing.  It just started a major effort to sell to large corporations in April, and has tripled corporate account sales in the last six months.  Deme Clainos, manager of direct sales at Apple, agrees that the Fortune 1000 want a ''safe'' company - but he doesn't think it has to be IBM.  Apple is working hard to infiltrate data processing and information systems departments in companies, and to prove to those department managers that the Apple Lisa and Macintosh are easier, better, and more reliable than the IBM. 
 Make no mistake, this is not Apple throwing IBM a bone.  No, IBM is the stronger enterprise brand lending legitimacy to the iPhone and iPad for business.  Big Blue is hired muscle for Apple.  The combination will create apps that can transform specific aspects of how businesses and employees work using iPhone and iPad, allowing companies to achieve new levels of efficiency, effectiveness and customer satisfaction -- faster and easier than ever before, says Apple.","Apple is better than ibm. 
On the one hand:
1) Apple announced the switch to Intel chips seven years ago because they ran faster and generated less heat than the products built by Motorola Inc. and IBM Corp. that Apple had used. 
2) That is why IBM compatibles flooded the market and gained such a large market share, not because they were better than the Apple machines. 
3) In earlier years, the Apple Macintosh computer was widely regarded to be superior to the IBM compatible computers, and the Mac OS was considered much better than Windows. 

On the other hand:
1) The research budgets of IBM or Xerox were undoubtedly much greater annually in the early1980s than they were for Apple or Microsoft. 
2) Two of its thirteen board members are women (which is a better proportion than Apple and obviously Facebook with zero). 
3) Those again are the kinds of services that HP and Dell were historically much better than Apple at providing for the PC industry.

2) IBM is worse than Apple about controlling their machines.

They look great, feel good in your hand, and they run very smoothly. The only thing missing from either of them was a fingerprint scanner. But now you can get one for free with iOS 8. And if you’re not happy with it, there are plenty of third-party apps out there. You just need to know how to use them. If you’ve never used an app before, here are some tips on using them: 1. Use it as a remote control. This will allow you to control everything without having to touch it. For example, when watching TV, you’ll be able to pause live TV by simply pressing pause. Or while playing games, you’ll be able to quickly switch between screens by swiping up from the bottom edge. It’s really easy to use. Just make sure it’s set up before you start playing. 2. Turn off all notifications. Notifications don’t work well on iPhones, so turn them off. You’ll still receive them, but they’ll no longer pop up."," The iPhone is a great product and the iPad has some cool features. But if you are looking for an Android tablet that can compete with Apple’s products, then look no further. This article will show how to get started on your own personal Android tablet. What Is An Android? A smartphone or tablet, also known as a smartphone, is any device which runs Android, Google’s mobile operating system. It includes all of the features found in other smartphones such as GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, camera, microphones, etc. However, it does not include many apps like those available on iOS. For example, there aren’t nearly enough games available. Also, most applications don’t work well when running on a small screen. There are, however, plenty of good free apps. Some popular ones include: Angry Birds, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Spotify, Google Maps, YouTube, Pandora, Netflix, Hulu, HBO Go, Amazon Prime, Crackle, Vudu. You can even install third-party applications."," The IPhone is a great phone, but it has one major flaw: the battery life. I have owned an iPhone since 2007, and my current phone was purchased in 2008. My original iPhone, which had been running iOS 4.1, still holds a charge for about two days without any use. This new iPhone 5 with iOS 7 runs out of juice after just over 24 hours. It also takes longer to charge. In addition, if you are using GPS or WiFi, your battery life will be significantly reduced. If you use Siri, Google Now, or other features, then this may not matter as much, but otherwise it’s very noticeable. To make matters worse, Apple’s newest phones do not come with NFC (Near Field Communication). You must purchase their expensive adapters that allow them to communicate directly with NFC. These adapters, however, only work on older versions of iOS. Newer devices like the iPad require Bluetooth LE 4.0 (or higher), so they don’t need these adapters. So what does all this mean for me?"," for that matter. The only thing I can say is the iPhone X will be a great phone, but it won’t have any of these features and that’s why it’s not going to sell as well as other phones with similar specs. It’s like saying “oh yeah you got your new iPhone, now go buy another one because this one’s just too expensive”. And if you’re still holding out hope on an OLED display then don’t hold your breath. It looks like they are working on something at least in the near future though. I’m glad you mentioned the camera too. I’ve been using my phone more than ever since getting it. With all the different modes available (portrait, landscape, etc) there’s so much room for creativity. My favorite mode is portrait where you get really creative with light and shadow. If you’ve never used it, try it! This was very interesting read. Thank you. I am also interested in what happens when we see the next generation of phones.","IBM's corporate image is just that: an image of a corporate giant. Apple's on the other hand is youthful, artistic, well-designed and (almost) pretentious. IBM sells consumer and enterprise hardware, software and services, while Apple markets primarily consumer and professionally focused hardware software and services.

On the one hand:

2) That is why IBM compatibles flooded the market and gained such a large market share, not because they were better than the Apple machines. 
3) Apple was the player that wanted it to be pronounced 'sexy' because they were (at the time) pushing SCSI as a technology that made their machines superior to IBM and the clone makers, who were generally not including SCSI interfaces. 
4) Apple announced the switch to Intel chips seven years ago because they ran faster and generated less heat than the products built by Motorola Inc. and IBM Corp. that Apple had used. 
5) Although I am a dedicated IBM clone user, Windows was not better than Apple, but won because of a better marketing.

On the other hand:
1) I chose IBM because they are extremely durable and because IBM offers much better warranty conditions than Apple. 
2) When Apple switched to Intel chips in 2005 it was because they not only ran faster than the PowerPC chips that Apple was using, designed by Motorola and IBM (NYSE: IBM ), but also because they generated less heat.

Also, Apple sells computers with only one processor core, which means that it can run multiple applications at once.",," I think that the only reason why Apple has been able to maintain a monopoly on their products for so long is because they have managed to get away with it. They are not innovating or trying anything new in order to make money. The fact is, if you want something new, then it will be invented by someone else. If you don't like it, then go out and find another product. There isn't much innovation going on."
2,ipod,phone,Christmas,What should I get for Christmas a new cellphone or an ipod?," A phone is the most important thing to have in your life. You can buy one on any carrier and it will work just fine. If you want something with more storage space, consider getting a bigger phone. The ipod touch has 32gb of storage, but if you are going to use that much space then you might as well go bigger. An iPod nano would be good too, although they don’t make them anymore. But remember that these devices aren’t meant to replace your phone, so you’ll need to keep up with it. You’ll also probably want some sort of music player like itunes. Itunes works great because it’s free. And finally, you may want to check out this site called mp3tunes.com, which offers free downloads of songs from all over the world. It doesn’t matter what kind of MP3 player, though, since there isn’t really anything special about them. Just download whatever song sounds interesting at first and see how long it takes before you decide whether you want to pay money for it.","I have a iPhone and i want to get an iPod touch but the only thing that would make me happy is if it was cheaper then my phone so can you tell me what iPod/iPhone/iPad are best for Christmas or any other time of year because im really looking forward to getting one thank you.

But if you want to get into it, you’ll find that for about half what you’d pay for a new car today, you’re getting something that’s more than twice as good. And while there’s no doubt that the CR-V will be hard to beat on price, there are some things worth considering when buying one. Here they are. Advertisement Fuel economy If you’ve ever driven a car, then chances are, your first thought after looking at this list would probably be, “Yeah, I know how bad gas prices are.” That’s because most cars today use less gasoline per mile traveled than their predecessors did back then. In fact, according to AAA, average U.S. drivers drive almost 10 miles farther each year now than they used to. So even though today’s vehicles aren’t quite as efficient as those from 20 years ago, they’re still pretty darn good overall."," The answer to this question depends on your needs and preferences. If you want a car that will last for years without any major repairs, then the Honda CR-V is probably what you’re looking for. However, if you’d like something more practical, with lots of features but also some room for improvement, then the Toyota RAV4 might be just right for you. Both cars are great value options in their own right, so it’s important to consider which one would suit your needs. Read our full review here. We Obsessively Cover The Auto Industry Hi!

","Toyota RAV4 is better than Honda CR-V. 
They can do it for any Toyota, any model, any trim.  Just ask about it.  The leather feels very rich and it is much better than Honda CR-V original factory leather. (Or factory Toyota leather for that matter.)  And make sure you lump the sum with your price and negotiate for the whole deal otherwise you'd be paying whatever you negotiate for the car + MSRP for leather ($1,300).  That's without heated seats. 
The Honda CR-V has better overall resale value than the Toyota RAV4. Automotive Lease Guide, a company that predicts residual value for new vehicles, rates the CR-V with its best five-star rating, signifying it as one of the leaders in resisting depreciation.  The RAV4 earns a four-star rating.  In its highest resale value configuration - 2009 CR-V EX with all-wheel drive - the CR-V is predicted to hold 59.39 percent of its original value after three years, according to Automotive Lease Guide.","Toyota RAV4 is better than Honda CR-V. 
On the one hand:
1) The Toyota RAV4 will be popular with taller drivers and passengers in the front seat, due to its greater front head- and legroom than the Honda CR-V. 
2) The Toyota RAV4 will certainly be a hit with tall motorists and their front seat guests, considering that it has better front head- and legroom than the Honda CR-V. 
3) The V6 is still a smoother ride than the V4 RAV or the V4 Honda CR-V. 

On the other hand: 
1) The video goes on to sell why the Honda CR-V is a better choice than the Toyota Rav4. 
2) In the Eco trim, the new turbo's economy is in line with the Honda CR-V (27/34/29) and better than the Toyota RAV4 (23/30/26). 
3) The Honda CR-V has better overall resale value than the Toyota RAV4.

But you should know that honda is easier, faster and weaker.","It's simple! Toyota is better, because it's faster, easier to drive and easier. But it will be useful for you to know that honda is earlier, easier to find and weaker."," The answer to that question depends on what you want from your car. If you’re looking for a car with the best fuel economy, then you’ll be happy with either of these two brands. But if you’d rather have something that’s more fun and sporty, then go with Honda. And while Toyota might not offer as much power in its hybrid cars, it does make some pretty cool cars like the Prius V. Which one do I choose? You can find out which brand makes the most fuel-efficient vehicles by comparing their EPA ratings against those of other cars. This will help you decide whether it’s worth buying an electric car, even though they may cost more."," in the US is a good example. The only thing that I can think of to explain this would be if there were some sort of cartel or something like that. But it seems unlikely given how many cars are sold and what they cost. If you look at the price per mile for an electric car compared with a gas car, it’s pretty much even. So why do people buy them? Because they’re convenient, because they don’t pollute as much, because their range isn’t so bad (I’m guessing about 100 miles on one charge), etc. And even though there’s no real reason to get one, most people do. It’s just not enough money to make them worth it. This was my first thought too. It doesn’t seem very likely though. A lot of people who want EVs have other reasons than price. They may also be concerned about climate change, but that’s another story. You might say that a large number of EV owners will never use them, which makes sense since they’ll probably end up being used less anyway."," in the last two races of the season. The first race was a close battle between the two Japanese manufacturers, with both cars finishing on top at Fuji Speedway. However, it wasn’t until the second race, where they were tied for second, that things really started to get interesting. After starting from pole position, Takuma Sato and Kazuki Nakajima took turns leading laps before being passed by Fernando Alonso who had been running third. At this point, there were only three drivers left in the race. Both teams pitted under green flag conditions, but neither driver made any attempt to pit again. This meant that if one team won their next race, then the other would be eliminated as well. In order to win the championship, each team needed four wins out of six races. With just five points separating them after seven races, the championship looked like it could go either way. But then, something strange happened. On lap 15, Kobayashi ran wide leaving him stranded behind his teammate Masashi Nakajima. As he tried to make up time, Nakajima went around him, allowing Kobayashi’s car to pass him."," and the other is a new company called Faraday Future. The car will be built in Shanghai by Chinese automaker BAIC Motor Co. It has been designed to compete with Tesla’s Model S sedan as well as BMW’s i3 electric car. “China is going through an industrial revolution right now,” said Jia Yueting, chairman of FAW, which was founded last year after he left his post at BYD.","If you're looking at 2005 models, get the CRV.  It is roomier and has a five speed automatic which improves performance and economy.  It also has standard side curtain airbags and stability + traction control.

In 2006, the RAV4 gets a significant upgrade.  The car is all new and signficantly nicer without a big increase in price.  The V6 model gets a monster 268 hp engine which makes the car as fast as many sports cars, while getting 28 mpg on the highway.  The 4 cylinder model remains a good value.  There is also a new option for a fold down third row seat, which is useful for children or short trips, and it closes the gap for safety features.  The RAV4 should range from 20-26K.  The 4 cylinder model should be hitting dealers now, whereas the V6 should be out in February.

Of course, this is only my opinion, you should test drive as much as you can before making a decision.",1,,0," The answer to this question depends on the type of car you drive. If you’re a daily driver, then it’s probably better to go with Honda. But if you’re looking for something more sporty, there’s no doubt that you’ll be happier with Toyota. Both cars are great in their own ways, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. For example, while the CRV-4 has an excellent handling system, it doesn’t offer much off-road capability. On top of that, its engine isn’t as powerful as some other Japanese cars.",," I have a CRV, and the only thing that makes it different from other cars in this class are its looks. The interior of my car looks like an old school car, with leather seats, steering wheel, etc. But when you drive it, it’s not as good as the Toyota. It has more power, but also less torque. And if you’re driving on city roads, you’ll notice how much slower your car is. It’s just because of the way the engine works. If you want to go fast, then you need power."
4,cider,juice,,What is the difference between apple juice and apple cider?," Apple cider has a higher alcohol content than apple juice. It also contains more sugar which can cause stomach upset or even vomiting. The reason why it is called “apple cider” instead of “apple juice”, is because apples are not considered to be fruits. Apples have been used as an ingredient in alcoholic beverages for thousands of years. They were first made by ancient Egyptians who believed that they could cure diseases. In fact, there was no such thing as medicine until modern times. Today, we use them to make drinks like beer, wine, cocktails, etc. However, if you want to drink something with real fruit juice, then go ahead and try it. You will probably enjoy it! How do I know what kind of apple cider I’m drinking? If you’re looking at your bottle of apple cider, you’ll see two things on it: A small number (maybe one out of every 100) says it’s 100% apple, while another shows up saying it’s only 50% apple. This means that either way, it’s still very good apple cider. But how does this help me?"," The answer to this question depends on what you want from a cider. If you’re looking for something that will give your drink the flavor of fresh fruit, then cider might be just right for you. But if you’d rather have some sweetness and tartness in your drink, then you’ll probably prefer apple or pear juice. And finally, if you’re more interested in having an alcohol content that’s higher than water, then maybe it’s best not to go with any other type of beverage. For these reasons, it can sometimes make sense to choose one kind over another. However, there are many different types of ciders out there, so don’t feel overwhelmed by all the choices. You could always try them all, but I would recommend trying at least two before deciding which one works best. What Are Some Common Types Of Ciders? There are several common styles of cider, each with its own unique flavor. These include apple, pear, cherry, grape, peach, raspberry, orange, lemon, lime, lemon juice, ginger beer, orange juice concentrate, and sparkling water.","Cider is better than juice. 
 Our apple cider is neither pasteurised nor filtered - which means that it will begin to ferment if kept at room temperature, turning into the drink Americans know as 'hard cider', and which we know as cider tout court .  Apple cider could be legally sold during the days of Prohibition and buyers could then ferment it at home.  Hence it found a niche market, and survived to take its place beside apple butter in the autumn larder.  Painful though it is for a disciple of Bacchus to say so, sweet, natural, untreated Virginian cider is incomparably superior to its alcoholic cousin, and better by far than the pasteurised, clarified apple juice that you can find on the supermarket shelf. 
 Jack's Hard Cider carries a modest 5.5 percent ABV -- alcohol by volume -- with a crystal-clear straw color and irresistible apple and floral notes.  Mouthwatering acidity and a pleasantly refreshing, light fizziness balance the soft and fruity, but basically dry finish.  To preserve and enhance freshness, Jack's Hard Cider comes in light weight, apple-green-colored aluminum cans.  The cans cool down faster than bottles, and the colder, the better, with a refreshing cider, Doughty says.","Cider is better than juice. 
On the one hand:
1) Crispin sibling, the Fox Barrel Cider Company is dedicated to the production of superior pear ciders, using fermented unpasteurized fresh-pressed pear-juice. 
2) Crispin affiliate, Fox Barrel Cider Company, is dedicated to the production of superior pure pear ciders, using fermented unpasteurized fresh-pressed pear juice. 
3) "" Crispin affiliate, Fox Barrel Cider Company, is dedicated to the production of superior pure pear ciders, using fermented unpasteurized fresh-pressed pear juice. 

On the other hand:
1) Medium amount of carbonation bubbles rushing to the top, and the beer is about the same color as natural apple juice--a tad bit lighter than apple cider. 
2) Reduce the apple cider: Place the apple cider (spiced or not spiced, but cider is better than apple juice) in a medium saucepan over high heat. 
3) ""The cans cool down faster than bottles, and the colder, the better, with a refreshing cider,"" Doughty says.

2) We've been told that our cider pressing fabric cleans easier and strains juice faster than other commercial-grade cider pressing fabrics on the market.

On the other hand:
1) ""The cans cool down faster than bottles, and the colder, the better, with a refreshing cider,"" Doughty says. 
2) I concur that Mott's juice is superior when making cider. 
3) Juice is filtered much better than cider and has asorbic acid added.","I would prefer to use cider because it's easier, faster and larger. But i should tell you that juice is faster, better for oily hair and cheaper.","It's simple! Cider is better, because it's faster, larger and easier. But it will be useful for you to know that juice is easier to find, better for oily hair and lighter."," The answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a drink that tastes like apple cider, then cider will be your best choice. However, if you prefer something more refreshing, then juice may be the better choice for you. Both of these drinks have their own unique taste and aroma. You can find out which one works best by tasting them both in order and comparing them. How do I know when my beverage has been pasteurized? When it comes to food products, there are two types of pasteurization methods used today: autoclaving (boiling water over high heat until all bacteria dies) and reverse osmosis (water with no additives). In general, they work very similarly. They differ only slightly in terms of how long the process takes – usually around 30 minutes for autoclaving, but up to an hour for reverse. This means that most foods should not go through any kind of processing before being consumed. Which method would you rather use?"," The first thing to know about cider is that it has a higher alcohol content than juice. This means you can drink more of it, but the calories are higher."," The first thing you need to know about cider is that it has a higher alcohol content than juice. This means that the amount of sugar in each glass will be higher. If you’re looking for something sweet and fruity, go with apple juice, but if you want more alcohol, try cider. You can also use different types of fruit juices. For example, apples are high in vitamin C so they should help lower your blood sugar. Apples have less calories per ounce compared to other fruits. Also, some fruits like peaches or strawberries contain natural sugars which may make them taste sweeter when used as an alternative beverage. What type of juice do I need? There aren’t any specific guidelines on how much water to put into a glass. However, there are two main ways to drink ciders – straight from the bottle or through a straw. A straw helps prevent unwanted spills by keeping all liquid inside the bottle. It also allows you to sip without having to tilt your head back.

Pour into glass jars and store at room temperature. Store in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks. Recipe Notes I used an electric hand mixer because it was easier than using my stand mixer. If you have one of those then use it. You can also do this by hand. Just make sure that your hands are clean before doing this. This is not necessary but will help prevent any bacteria from growing. To keep these delicious treats fresh, refrigerate them after they come out of the fridge. They should be good for about 2-3 days.

Apple cider, is apple juice steeped with cinimon sticks.

My favorite recipie is to take applie juice, steep about 6 sticks of cinimon, a bit of all spice and a small pinch of nutmeg for about 1 hour.

When done, strain, chill and serve with ice :)",1,,1,  Apple cider has a higher alcohol content than apple juice. The reason for this is that apples are grown in warmer climates where they have more sugar available to them. This means there will be less of an impact on your blood sugar. It also helps with weight loss because it contains fewer calories.,,"  Cider has been around for a long time, and it still is. It was invented in the UK by an Englishman named James Cook. He used to drink apple juice every day because he thought that would make him feel better. But when his wife told him about the health benefits of drinking cider, he decided to try it. And so began one of the most popular drinks on earth.The first recorded use of “cider” as a term came from this English author."
5,ds,psp,RPG gamer,"What is better for an RPG gamer for a hand held system for xmas, a Sony PSP or a Nintendo DS?"," I have the same question about the 3DS and Vita. The Vita has been out since last year but it seems like they are still trying to figure things out. They need more games on there that will appeal to people who don’t own any of their other systems. Also why can’t we get some new titles from Nintendo? Why do you think so many companies want exclusive rights to make games? It’s not right when your company can just release whatever game they want. It makes me mad because I’m sure if my favorite video game was released by another company, I’d be very happy. But with Sony, it’s all about making money off of games. If you’re going to put out a game, then at least give us something new. And as far as the 3DS, well that’s what happens in Japan. You see them selling millions of these consoles every year. So what’s different here? Just wait until next year, maybe they’ll start releasing some good titles. @rjejr – I agree with you. I also feel this way about the Wii U."," I have played the first two games and they are both very good. The only thing that bothers me about them is how much time it takes to get from one place to another. It seems like you can just walk everywhere in this game but if you want to go somewhere else then you need a car. Also there isn’t really any reason why you would have to drive around on foot. You could take public transportation or even use your own car as long as it’s not too far away from where you’re going. But other than that, great game. Can’t wait till next week! This looks awesome!! I’m glad they’re finally making some progress with their RPG series after all these years. I’ve been waiting so long for this!!! And while we’re at it, please make more of those awesome PS4 exclusive titles too! :D @11 – It’s actually pretty easy to find out what kind of system someone has by looking at their Steam profile. If you’ve got a PC that’s under Windows 7, you’ll see “Windows” listed there.","Psp is better than ds. 
 Nintendo's just hurting themselves by not using UMD's.  Sure discs can break easier than cartridges if your wreckless will your stuff,but look at all the advantages PSP will have over DS because of UMD alone.PSP's games will look and sound ALOT better than DS's.  Probably bigger than the visual difference between PS2 and Xbox games.As I said before,PSP's games will cost less and be easier to develop for.So if I'm right then this means PSP will have more games coming out faster than DS.

On the one hand:
1) Overall, CW for the PSP is a slightly better version of the game than the DS original. 
2) Many people think psp sucks but its better than the DS.

On the other hand: 
1) The DS is way better than the PSP. 
2) An iPod, DS lite- do what I need, better than a PSP would. 
3) the ds is even easier than psp to hack but look at the succses it made.

2) Much better than anything DS has to offer. 
3) The PSP CPU is light-years faster than the DS, but the DS answers back with better games and an easier to learn experience.

3) So that's a short list of why the DS is superior to the PSP.","After much thought, I realized that  psp is better, because it's easier to develop forso if i m right then this means psp will have more games coming out faster, bigger and easier. Ds is faster, easier to emulate and easier.","I came to the conclusion that psp is better, because it's cleaner, higher and easier to learn experience. But you should know that ds is longer and easier to emulate."," I have a psp and i love it but the only thing that sucks about it is that you cant play games on it. But if your looking to get into gaming then this would be perfect because of all the great games. And also its cheaper than buying a pc so thats another plus. If youre just getting in to playing video games then go with the ps3 cause they are more powerful and can do alot more. Also there are many good free online sites like xbox live which has tons of games plus youtube videos as well. So if you’re new to gaming then buy the ps vita first before investing money into a computer. The PSP was made by Sony for people who don’t want to spend hundreds of dollars on a game console. It isn’t meant to compete against other consoles such as Xbox, Wii, etc. It’s intended to provide gamers with a portable system that’s easy to use yet powerful. This means it’s not designed for hardcore gaming. You can’t compare it to any console out there."," I have to say that the game is very well designed and has a lot of depth. The combat system is also quite good with lots of different ways you can approach combat. You will find yourself using your skills in many situations which makes it more interesting. There are so many things going on at once that there really isn’t time to get bored. This is one of those games where if you don’t play it, you’ll regret it. It takes some getting used to, but after playing through once, it’s easy to pick up again. What do you think about this game? Do you like it? Let us know what you thought below. About Matt Wales I'm a huge fan of all types of games, especially RPGs, turn-based strategy (RTS) and platformers. My favorite genre is probably action games. If you're looking for something different, give me a shot!"," The first thing to note is that the PsP has a higher base damage than the DD. This means it will be able to take more hits and deal less damage. It also makes sense for this class because of its low cooldown on both abilities. As such, I would recommend using your skills in order as you see fit. If you’re not comfortable with how much time you have left, then use one skill at a time. When you are ready to switch back into another skill, just do it. You can always go back later if needed. Another important point about these two abilities is their duration. While they last longer, they’re still short enough so that you won’t feel like you’ve wasted too many seconds when switching between them. In fact, it’s often better to wait until after you finish an ability before switching. For example, let’s say you want to change from a sword swing to a shield swing. Your second attack should only cost 2 seconds, but since you can’t move while doing it, you’ll need to spend 4 seconds. That’s 3 extra seconds!",who wants to play a game with the same feel as playing in real life and not just sit around waiting for something to happen. I think that is what you are trying to say but it sounds like your saying this because of the lack of RPG games out there right now. You want more RPGs so you will buy them. But if they don’t have them then you won’t buy them. So why do people keep buying them? Because they know it’s going to be good no matter what. And that’s how we all are. We always try new things even when we’re scared about it. It’s our nature. If you’re afraid of change then you’ll never get anywhere. That’s why I’m glad that most of us gamers are still stuck on the old ways of doing things. The only way forward now would be to go back to those days where everything was easy and everyone knew everything. Now we need to learn from our mistakes instead of repeating them.,"Earlier this week, the ultimate RPG was announced for the PSP. There will be a Final Fantasy coming to the PSP.

If I'm not mistaken, it appears that both versions will be coming out at some point during the holiday season. Is there any way we can get more information about this? Thanks!",,"  I think it depends on what you want to do with your system. If you’re a hardcore RPG, then the DS has more power and flexibility in terms of game play options. But if you’re looking at just playing games that are designed specifically for the DS, there really isn’t much difference. The only difference between the two systems would be how many titles they support.What about the Vita? Is it worth it?It’s definitely not as good as the DS. It doesn’t have nearly enough games."

It also makes some pretty cool products. But it doesn’t have the same kind of passion for its products as Apple. And it’s not nearly as good at making money. If you’re looking for an example of how Apple’s business model differs from Microsoft’s, look no further than iTunes. It’s one thing when iTunes sells music over the Internet. That’s just another way in which Apple can make more money off your music. But if you want to buy music, or movies, or TV shows, or games, or books, or magazines, or newspapers, or anything else online, then there’s nothing like buying them through iTunes, because there are so many other places where they sell them.

2) Apple has better programmers, so it's able to write tighter, faster, stronger code than Microsoft. 
3) Explain to me again why Apple's way is ""better"" for users and how, exactly Apple is moving faster than Microsoft.","After much thought, I realized that  microsoft is better, because it's faster, easier to use and easier.

But it will be useful for you to know that apple is faster, smarter and safer."," I think the answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If your goal is just a good web browser, then Microsoft Edge will do fine. But if you want something that can replace all of your other browsers and apps for one simple reason: it works better than them, then Google Chrome might be better. It has more features like tabs, bookmarks, offline mode, etc. And it’s free. The best part about using Chromium over Firefox is its speed. When compared with Firefox, Chromium’s speed is much faster. This means that when you’re browsing the web, there isn’t any lag time between clicking an icon in the address bar and seeing the page load. You don’t have to wait around while pages load up before getting into action. With Firefox, you’ll often see websites take several seconds longer to load, because they need to download images from CDNs. In addition, many sites use Flash which slows down performance. Another advantage of Chromium, besides speed, is privacy."," The two companies are locked in a legal battle over patents related to the iPhone. In April, Judge Lucy Koh ruled that Samsung had infringed on Apple's patent for slide-to-unlock technology. But she also said it was not clear whether Samsung's actions were ""willful"" or ""unintentional."" She ordered both sides to file briefs by June 30. On Monday, Apple filed its own brief arguing against the judge's ruling. It argues that the judge erred when he found that Samsung did not have standing because of an earlier decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. That court held last year that Samsung could be liable if it sold products with features similar to those used in Google's Android operating system. ""Apple has been and continues to be at odds with Google regarding Android,"" wrote Craig Federighi, senior vice president of corporate communications for Apple."," The battle between the two largest tech companies in the world has been going on for a long time. In fact, it goes back to when Steve Jobs was still at Apple. He wanted to create an operating system that would be as easy and intuitive to use as Windows but with more features. This is where he got his inspiration from Bill Gates. Gates had created Windows, which allowed users to run programs without having to install them first. However, this meant that people who did not have computers could only access these programs, so they were limited by their computers. Jobs decided instead of creating something like this, he should make one program that everyone could use. That way anyone can download any program, regardless if it’s free or not. And since there are many different kinds of computers, you will always find someone willing to help you. That’s why we call him “Apple.” So what does this mean for you? Well, first off, your computer may become much faster than before. Second, you’ll probably get used to using it."," to make a phone that can do everything the iPhone does and more.

I will NEVER go back to PCs. I use them at work, and I so appreciate not seeing the 'blue screen of death' anymore. I also like that Macs are simplified for basic things such as photos, music, internet and e-mail. Truthfully, the only programs I have issues with are Microsoft applications like Word and IE. I use a Canon camera, Epson printer, and an Apple iPod. You just plug them in and use them. no sweat. I got a refurbished eMac and am about to get an iPod from the apple store's refurbished section as well. 

I think Apple's superiority comes from the fact that Macs are inherently more stable systems since everything is manufactured by apple instead of having a microsoft operating system, pentium processor, etc. 

As for compatibility (which is what scares most people about the switch) I have very few problems. The only things that dont' work for me are Google Earth and Yahoo! Games. 2 things I DO NOT need to further waste time at home online!!

Hope this was helpful...",1,"The microsoft is better than apple. 

On the other hand: 
1) Only Apple is better than Microsoft, because they usually deliver MORE than they tell you, and the OS gets faster with each point release, instead of slower. 
2) Apple consumers are generally easier to please than Microsoft consumers, because the product performs better. 
3) Not entirely correct, they did work for Apple, but that's because Apple was smarter than Microsoft. 
4) By the way, Google Play charges developers the same 30% for what is arguably a worse deal (because the Apple store is far better at delivering sales.) 
5) Just because the phone is truly fantastic doesn't make apple any better than the evil that Microsoft was 5 years ago (actually Apple is worse) .",0," I think the biggest difference between Windows and Mac OS X is that Windows has a lot of things in common with MacOS, but it also has some unique features. For example, there are many more applications available for Windows, including Office 2007 (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Outlook, OneNote, etc.) than on Mac. Also, Windows can run multiple programs at once without any problems. On Mac, if one program crashes, another will automatically be started to replace it.",," I think it depends on what you mean by better. If you're talking about the quality of a product, then yes, Apple products are better, but if you're comparing apples to apples, Microsoft has been around for longer and has more experience with software development. The fact that they have had so much success in this area shows how far they've come.As for Microsoft, they're still trying to figure out their next big thing.

7,dell,ibm,,Which is better Lenovo (IBM) or Dell?," I think Dell has a very good chance to win the tablet market in 2012. They have an excellent product line and they are selling well. The problem for them will be that their tablets do not compete with Apple products on price. If you look at what Microsoft did last year, it was really bad because they were competing against Apple. This year they should focus more on price competition than competition. That way they can get some of those people who buy iPads but don’t like Windows 8 on their tablets. What about Apple’s iPad Mini, which costs $199 when purchased directly from Apple, versus $100 if bought through Amazon? Is this going to hurt sales of the iPad? It depends how much money Amazon makes off it. It’s hard to say. But it’s certainly hurting sales. You can’t make any money by making your own tablet. That’s why we see so many companies trying to create them. We saw one company try to sell its own tablet, called the Kindle Fire."," I think so. But the question is, does Dell have a chance to win it all? The good news for Dell is that they are still in this tournament. They will be playing their first game on Friday against the winner of Group B and Group C, which means they’ll play two games over four days before facing off with Brazil in the quarterfinals. That gives them plenty of time to get ready for Brazil. And if you look at what happened last year, it’s not hard to see why Dell would want to go through all that. Last year was an incredible run by Dell. It started out as one of those Cinderella runs where everyone thought they’d won it, but then things turned around pretty quickly. In fact, the team went from being just another underdog story to having some real momentum. This year’s tournament has been no different. So far in group play, Dell hasn’t lost yet. They’ve already beaten Canada 2-0 in the opening game, beat Mexico 1-0 in the second match, and now they’re going up against Brazil, who they’ve never played before.","Ibm is better than dell. 
 IBM falls further behind in blades .  the chassis really limits what they can offer on a blade, especially in memory capacity.  IBM sales' answer of course, is to go to a double-wide blade and although this doesn't pass the sniff test, those that blindly bleed IBM blue will buy this argument.  The reality though is that IBM is losing market share faster than The Titanic took on water in the blades space to better competition from HP and to a lesser degree Dell.

On the one hand:
1) IBM is capable of performing a tiny bit better than Dell thanks to its custom high performance chipset. 
2) I personally think that Apple's build quality has gone down in the past few years -- they're better than Dell is at the moment, but worse than Lenovo/IBM. 
3) IBM ( NYSE: IBM     ) -- perhaps a better fit than Dell as HP's closest rival after Hurd's EDS acquisition -- has treated shareholders to market-thumping gains in that time, but the stock hasn't doubled. 

On the other hand: 
1) Dell has done a better job than IBM and cHomPaq in this area. 
2) Ultimately, we managed to get a set of numbers off the chassis with two blades running and the remainder of the blades removed, which showed power efficiency to be on par with Dell and better than IBM.

Dell is lighter, easier and easier to become an ibm."," I think the answer to that question depends on what you want from a laptop. If you’re looking for something with great battery life, this isn’t it. But if you’d rather have a laptop that’s light and portable but still has some power behind it, then it’s hard not to recommend Dell’s Inspiron. It’s got an excellent screen, good performance, decent speakers, and it doesn’t feel like it’ll break anytime soon. The only downside of course is its price. At $999, it’s more expensive than most other laptops in Dell's lineup, which makes sense given how well they perform. Still, at least it's affordable.

In its most recent quarter, IBM reported revenue of $19.1 billion, up from $9.8 billion in fiscal 2016. That was down slightly from $10.4 billion last year, but still higher than any other company except Google. IBM’s chief executive, Ginni Rometty, said on Thursday that she expected sales growth this year would be “modest” because it is difficult to predict how much demand there will be. But Ms. Rometty added that she did not expect the company’s business model to change. She noted that her predecessor, Sam Palmisano, had been fired after just three years at the company. “We have always believed we could deliver what customers want when they need it,” Ms. Rometty said."," The two companies are in a legal battle over the rights to sell computers and tablets under their own brand names. In April, Dell sued Ibb’s parent company, International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), accusing it of infringing on Dell’s patents for its “ThinkPad” tablet computer. IBM’s lawyers have argued that the company is not trying to steal any trade secrets from Dell, but rather wants to protect its intellectual property. A federal judge ruled against IBM last month, saying that while there was no evidence that IBM’s business model had been compromised, the case should be dismissed because the patent infringement claim lacked merit. But after an appeal by IBM, Judge William Alsup said he would allow the lawsuit to go forward as long as both sides agreed to settle. On Friday, however, Alsup denied IBM’s request to dismiss the case."," to get the job done. The only thing that could make this worse is if they take a big step back and trade for another player like Paul Millsap or DeAndre Jordan. That would be an absolute disaster. They need someone who can run with Westbrook and/or Durant on offense and defend them both. It doesn’t matter how good you are defensively as long as you’re able to play offense. If they’re unable to do that, then it’s just going to be really hard to win in Oklahoma City. I think it will come down to whether or not Russell Westbrook wants to stay in OKC. He has two more years left at his current contract after next season, so there’s no rush to move him. But he may want out of town regardless. And that’s what makes me nervous about bringing him back. He’s still under contract, but he’s getting up there in age (31) and coming off major knee surgery. It’s possible he’ll decide to go somewhere else where he won’t have to worry about playing anymore.

The company was founded in the late 1800s, and it still exists today. It also makes some of the best computers on the market today, including its own line of gaming PCs.

That said, if you’re looking for something with an excellent screen, good battery life, and plenty of ports, you should definitely consider buying one from Dell.",,"  I am not sure what you mean by “better”. Dell has a lot of good products and they have been around for quite some time. They are also very reliable in terms of their products. The only thing that could be considered as an advantage over them would be the fact that they offer more RAM options compared to other manufacturers. However, if your question was about whether or not it makes sense to buy Dell. My answer would definitely say yes."

The only thing that really matters to me is how well they perform. If it can get up and go in a straight line then I’m happy. But if it’s going to take off on its own with no steering wheel control, that’s not for me. It’s just too dangerous. And as far as fuel economy, well, my wife has an old VW Beetle which gets about 20 mpg when she’s driving. So we don’t have any problems there. What’s your favorite car? My first car, actually, was a Ford Mustang. It had a V8 engine and a manual transmission. That was it. Then there were two other cars from Ford: one was a convertible called the Mustang II and another was a convertible. They both got better mileage than anything else I’d ever driven.

Bmw is faster, better for the environment and lighter.","smth wrong in answer generation, please try again"," The answer to that question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a car with an aggressive look, then go for BMW. But if you prefer something more refined, and have money to spend, then look at Toyota. They offer both of these cars in their lineup, but they also have some other models as well. You can find them all over the world, so it would be hard not to. However, I think there are two main differences between the two. First off, the Lexus IS has a much higher price tag than its rivals. It starts from about $80,000, while the BMW M5, which started around $75,000, costs only slightly more. This means that even though the Lexus IS might cost more, it will definitely give you a lot more bang for your buck. Secondly, the BMW M5 is built by one company, whereas the Lexus IS was manufactured by several companies. That makes it easier to get parts when needed. For example, you don’t need to worry about getting spare tires because BMW offers that.
"," The answer is a bit more complicated than that. In the case of the BMW, it has to do with its larger size and higher weight compared to other luxury sedans. This makes for an SUV that can carry heavier loads in terms of cargo space, but also requires less fuel consumption. However, this does not mean that the BMW will be able to compete directly against the Audi A8 or Mercedes-Benz S-Class, which are both much smaller vehicles when you compare their overall size. Instead, they have to go head-to-head with the Lexus RX 450h and Ford F-150 Raptor, two very different vehicles. Both these cars offer plenty of room inside as well as lots of luggage space. But what really sets them apart from each other, however, is how comfortable they are. These three models all boast premium seats and luxurious interiors, while offering great driving dynamics. They even come equipped with heated seats, so if you’re looking for something that’s going to make your commute on public transport easier, then look no further than the Lexus."," The answer is that the two are very different cars. Both have a long history of being used by law enforcement agencies and military forces. But while both cars can be found in many police departments around the world, they differ greatly when it comes to their capabilities. For example, the Ford Mustang has been used as an armored vehicle for decades. It was also built into some U.S. Army vehicles during World War II. And despite its popularity, the car hasn’t really changed much since then. In fact, it’s still one of Ford’s most popular models. However, the BMW M5 Sedan isn’t quite so well known outside of Germany. It’s not even on sale here yet. That means there aren’t too many people who know about it. That’s why we decided to take a look at what makes this German luxury sedan stand out from other sports sedans. What Makes This Car So Unique? While all three models share similar features, they’re each unique enough to make them worth looking at."," The answer is that the new generation of cars will be more like a modern sports car than an SUV and they should have much better fuel economy than their predecessors.

The only thing in common between them is their price. And if you’re looking for something to drive around town in, then I’d go with the BMW. But if you’re going on long trips and want more than just an occasional trip out of town, then get the Toyota. It’s got all those features plus it’s cheaper. Do you like the new look of the cars? If so, which ones are your favorites? I’m not really into styling as much anymore. You can tell by my car. My wife likes it because she thinks its cute. It looks good from every angle. How important was it for you to make sure there were no surprises when designing this vehicle? For me it wasn’t important. All we had to worry about was making sure everything worked properly. We didn’t need any surprises. Everything has been designed so well that nothing could be wrong. Did you design anything special for the showroom? No, really.","The answer is a resounding yes. In fact, the two companies are neck-and-neck in terms of market share. According to J.D. Power and Associates, which tracks auto sales, Toyota’s Camry was the best-selling vehicle last year with an average sales price of $49,900. Chrysler’s minivan sold just under half as many vehicles at about $28,000. Both brands have been able to maintain their lead over rivals by offering premium products that appeal to younger buyers. But while they may be selling more cars overall, both automakers still face stiff competition from new entrants like Honda ( HMC - news - people ), Hyundai Motor America ( HYA - news - people ) and Nissan Motors Corp. (Nissan). And even though Ford has made inroads into its core North American market, it faces stiffer competition. Last year, Fords Lincoln brand lost ground against General Motors, whose Chevrolet division posted record sales.

And of course Jim had recently been appointed as a member of Toyota's Board of Directors - the first non-Japanese in that position.  Jim will be stepping away from all of that at Toyota and into a different situation.

This Chrysler opportunity was a challenge probably greater than any he would have been offered at Toyota.
The Japanese auto makers are better on average.  Toyota is 23% faster than Chrysler. But the time to make a car varies from plant to plant. ","The toyota is better than chrysler. 
On the one hand: 
1) Toyota is 23% faster than Chrysler. 
2) This means that while Toyota is 13% better than the industry average, Chrysler is exactly the opposite, 13% worse.

On the other hand:
1) Body rigidity is inferior to Chrysler. 
2) The 3.6 in the Lacrosse/CTS (and Chrysler 3.5) better but still behind even what 'little ole' Hyundai has done - never mind the truly superior efforts from Toyota/Honda/Nissan. 
3) This Chrysler opportunity was a challenge probably greater than any he would have been offered at Toyota.
","The toyota is SUV than chrysler. 
On the one hand:
1) I'm surprised you haven't received a flood of comments claiming all Toyotas are lousy death traps doomed to be recalled any minute, and vastly inferior to anything from Ford, GM, or even Chrysler/Fiat. 
2) There were all sorts of problems including the fact that Chrysler vehicles were inferior to Japanese vehicles, especially the long-lasting Toyota automobiles. 
3) Why anyone would pay 5 or 6 grand more for one of these death traps than for a much safer and far more reliable Ford, GM or Chrysler product (as well as keeping American money in American hands) is beyond me. 

On the other hand: 
1) It seems to me that Chrysler, with most of its eggs in one basket, the U.S., does better profitwise than those global companies such as GM and Toyota. 
2) For all the hoopla I believe Chrysler builds a better minivan transmission than Honda, about as good as Toyota does.

","I would prefer to use toyota because it's faster, easier and reputation. But it will be useful for you to know that chrysler is easier to use, easier and faster.","I came to the conclusion that toyota is better, because it's greater, faster and older.

If you’re a daily driver, then it’s probably better for Toyota than Chrysler. But if you’re looking at buying your first car, and want something that will last longer than two years, then it might be best for both companies. In terms of fuel economy, I think you’ll find that in most cases, the difference between the two brands isn’t significant. For example, my 2012 Corolla has an EPA rating of 22 miles per gallon city, 28 mpg highway, but only gets about 17 MPG combined city/highway. That’s not bad, considering how much gas we use here in Southern California. And while I’m sure some people would argue that there are other factors involved (driving style, weather, etc. ), I’d say those aren’t really relevant here. So what do you think? Which brand makes more sense for you?"," and the other two are a bit of an unknown. The first thing to note is that this isn’t just about one company. This is about three companies with very different business models but similar market share in their respective segments. It’s also about how each company has been able to use its dominant position to force out competitors from within its own market. In fact, it’s not even clear if any of these automakers have ever actually competed against each other. Rather, they all seem to be trying to do things differently. And that’s why we see so many new cars coming off production lines every year. That’s because there aren’t really any established players left who can offer anything like what they’re offering now. So let’s look at some numbers."," The most important thing to understand about the current situation is that it has nothing whatsoever to do with what was promised by either of these two companies. It had everything to do with their own greed. In a nutshell, both companies were in business for themselves and not at all concerned about the people who bought cars from them. They made money on selling cars, but they didn’t care if you drove them or not. If you wanted an automobile then you’d have to buy one yourself. And that’s exactly how things worked until recently. When I say “they” I’m referring to the government which bailed out the auto industry after GM went bankrupt. This bailout cost taxpayers $85 billion dollars over ten years. That’s more than half of our entire annual budget. But this wasn’t just any bailout. It’s called TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program). So why did we get into this?"," to build a new plant in Mexico and export the cars back into the U.S. Trump has repeatedly threatened tariffs on Mexican imports if he can’t negotiate better terms for American workers. He also wants to rework NAFTA so that it favors companies like his own. But there are many obstacles standing between him and such an outcome. The biggest is Trump’s own protectionist instincts. In fact, he’s already tried this before. Back when he was running for president, he said he’d be willing to walk away from trade deals with other countries if they weren’t fair to Americans. That didn’t happen. And now it’s unclear whether he’ll even try. We want to hear what you think about this article.

1) And Ford probably stands to benefit most among the domestic manufacturers, largely because it enjoys a better reputation and a more comprehensive line-up of competing vehicles than G.M. or Chrysler.

Any ideas?"""," The answer to that question depends on how you define “better.” In the case of Ford, it seems like a no-brainer. But in terms of overall performance, Nissan has been better. And that’s not just because it’s more fuel efficient. It’s also because its engines are better, and they have better handling characteristics. If you’re going to compare apples with apples, then Ford’s engine performance isn’t as good as Nissan’s. So why would anyone buy an Infiniti when they’re getting such great value from their car? I think this is where people get confused. They don’t understand what makes one car better than another. They’re comparing apples to oranges – which doesn’t make any sense. You can say that about almost anything. For example, if you want to know whether or not your new iPhone 6 Plus will be faster than last year’s model, you’ll need to do some comparative shopping. You’ll probably end up buying both phones at once.

But i should tell you that nissan is greater and easier to drive a ford."," The answer to this question depends on your point of view. If you want a car that will last for years and years, then the choice between these two companies should be obvious. However, if you are looking for something with good fuel economy but also comfort and convenience, then Nissan has got it all over Ford. In fact, in terms of overall performance, they have more than twice as many miles per gallon as Ford! This makes them an excellent choice. But what about price? Well, there really isn’t much difference between the two. Both cars start at around $31,000, which means that even though both vehicles come from Japan, their prices are pretty comparable. And while we don’t know how long each model will last, it’s safe to say that neither one will break down anytime soon. So, when choosing one, make sure you’re not paying too much. Which Car Should You Buy? There are several factors that go into making up our final decision regarding any car."," The first thing to note is that the new car will be a completely different design from its predecessor. It has been designed with more aggressive styling and features such as a larger front grille and rear diffuser. This means it should look even better on the road than before. However, there are some differences between this model and previous models. For example, the interior of the vehicle was redesigned for 2018 while the exterior remained unchanged. There were also changes in terms of engine power output. In addition, the price tag went up by €1,300. As you can see below, the new car is expected to cost around $70,000 when it’s released later next year. That makes it one of the most expensive cars ever sold in Europe. 2019 Lincoln MKX – New Car Line Up Revealed We have already seen several pictures of the upcoming 2019 Lincoln MKX. These include an image showing what appears to be a prototype version which could mean that we might get our very own test mule soon."," for the first time in a long time, and it was pretty damn good. The new Camry is an excellent car that will be hard to top. It has all of the qualities we have come to expect from Toyota – great handling, good looks, and solid reliability. And it’s not just about the exterior, either. It’s also got some very nice interior touches like heated seats, power windows, and even air conditioning. This makes this one of our favorite cars on sale right now. We love how much more room there is inside than before. With its larger trunk area, you can fit plenty of stuff inside. You won’t need to worry about your groceries spilling out when you’re driving down the road. Plus, with the rear seats folded down, there’s still enough space behind them so they don’t get squished together. If you’ve been looking at getting into the luxury SUV game, but are worried about cost, then look no further. Chevrolet made sure that their latest offering would meet or exceed every single requirement you’d want in any SUV."," and the other is a Japanese company that has been around for over 100 years. The reason why I think this will be more difficult to do in Canada than it was with China is because of our current system where we have two different types of vehicle registration system. One type allows you to register your car as long as it’s not stolen from you, whereas another kind requires you to provide proof of insurance. This means if you’re driving on an unpaved road without insurance, you’ll need to get insurance before registering it. And then there’s also the fact that, unlike China, we’re still using paper registrations instead of electronic ones. So even though there are fewer cars registered, they can all easily track down who owns them. That’s one thing that’s going to make it harder here. But what about Canada? Well, let’s look at Canada. We don’t use any sort of centralized database like China. Instead, we rely on each province’s own records which are kept by their local government departments. In Ontario, for example, every municipality maintains its own records.","My favorite car is a Shelby GT500E Super Snake. It has a 427 Cobra engine with 525 horsepower, plus it comes with the Shelby Vortex Supercharger which gives it an amazing 725 total horsepower.

11,dell,sony,,Which laptop do you recommend? Dell? Sony? IBM? Other?," I have a Dell Latitude D630. It is very fast and has great battery life. The screen resolution is excellent. There are two USB ports on the left side of the laptop. One for charging my phone or tablet and one for data transfer. You can also use it as an external hard drive. Also there is a card reader that allows me to read SD cards from other devices. This was important because I had some photos taken with my Nikon camera which were not compatible with Windows 7 so I could only view them in Windows. Now they work perfectly through this card. What kind of computer should I get? A MacBook Pro 13” Mid 2012 edition. If possible, get a Retina display model. My current model is still working well. However, if money allows, I’d like to upgrade to something faster. I’m looking at getting either a new Mac Mini or a newer iMac. Both will be faster than what I’ve got now. But I’ll need more storage space anyway."," The answer to that question depends on what you mean by “better.” If you’re referring to the quality of Dell’s products and service, then yes, it is. But if you’re talking about how well its competitors are doing, well, it’s not so good. In fact, according to a recent report from IDC, Dell has fallen behind Sony in terms of overall PC shipments. And while that’s bad news for Dell, it’s also good news. It means more people will buy Dells instead of other brands. It’s just another sign that Dell’s fortunes have been buoyed by an improving economy. So why does Dell need to do this? Well, as I mentioned above, Dell needs to be able to sell computers at lower prices because there’s no way they can compete with companies like Apple or Microsoft when it comes to selling high-end PCs. That makes them vulnerable to price cuts — which could happen any day now — but even so, they’re still losing money every time someone buys one of their computers. That’s where Dell gets into trouble.","Sony is better than dell. 
 That's a good thing.  Integrated Intel HD 4000 graphics are a nice step up from last year's integrated HD 3000 version, and can play most mainstream games on low to medium settings.  At 0.7 inch thick and 3.68 pounds, the IdeaPad U310 is thin and light, but not quite as thin and light as other 13-inch ultrabooks.  However, some ultrabooks are starting to include higher-end graphics, like the Dell Inspiron 14z, whose AMD graphics provide another bump for games and video-intensive applications.  It's somewhere between normal 13-inch laptop and ultrabook, and feels more like the former.  Those upgrades will cost you extra, generally: the Inspiron 14z costs a hundred dollars more at $899.  It's heavier than the Sony Vaio T ultrabook, and lighter than the new Dell Inspiron 14z. Multimedia multitasking test (in seconds) (Shorter bars indicate better performance) .

2) For those who demand immediate gratification and cannot wait, the two Pentium III 500-MHz systems I like best are the Dell Dimension XPS T-500 (for its superior value) and the Sony PCV-L600 (for its innovating styling).

Sony is better, because it's larger, bigger and heavier. But it will be useful for you to know that dell is easier to deal with and easier."," I have a Sony Vaio laptop and it has been working fine for me since the day i bought it. The only problem with this computer was that my battery life would last about 2 hours when fully charged. But now after installing Windows 7 on it, it lasts up to 5 hours. And if you are looking at buying an ultrabook then definitely go for one of these because they will be cheaper than other brands. This is also why there are so many different brands out there. You can get something good from any brand. If your budget allows you buy a new laptop, but do not want to spend too much money, then look into getting a netbook. These computers usually cost less than $400, which makes them perfect for college students. They run very fast, have great graphics, and come in all kinds of colors. There are even some models that offer more memory than most desktops. Netbooks make excellent gifts as well. All you need to know before purchasing one, however, is whether it’s worth spending money on."," The first thing to note is that the new XPS 13 has a much better keyboard than its predecessor, and it also comes with an improved trackpad as well. This means you can use your fingers on both sides of the keyboard, which makes typing more comfortable. You don’t have to press down hard or long for each keystroke, either. It’s really quite amazing. I was able to type faster and longer without any wrist pain. It feels like you’re actually using a laptop instead of just holding a tablet in one hand. Another big improvement over last year’s model is how well this machine handles multitasking. With two screens, you’ll be able to run multiple apps at once, including those from Windows 10. You’ll even get some extra screen real estate by switching between portrait and landscape modes. And if you want to watch movies while working on other tasks, there’s now a dedicated button right there so you won’t miss anything. As far as specs go, it’s not too shabby."," The first thing to note is that the new XPS 13 has a much better display than its predecessor. It’s not quite as bright and vivid as Apple’s Retina MacBook Pro, but it’s still very good. In fact, it looks almost identical in terms of color reproduction, brightness, contrast, sharpness, etc. To be fair, though, you can see some differences between the two displays when comparing side-by-side at normal viewing distances. At full size, however, there’s no real difference between them. This isn’t just about pixel density. It also means that the screen on this laptop is more reflective than previous models. That is, while Apple uses an anti-glare coating for their displays, Dell’s screens are actually made from glass rather than plastic. That’s important because it allows them to use less power during operation. When you’re using your computer all day long, that’s important. As far as other specs go, there aren’t many surprises here. Both laptops have Intel Core i5 processors with 8GB RAM each, which should provide plenty of performance under most circumstances."," to make a computer that is more powerful than the one you have. The problem with this argument is that it assumes that there are two types of people in the world: those who can afford PCs and those who can't. If we assume that everyone has access to PCs, then it's not clear why anyone would want one. But if we're going to have an argument, let's start by acknowledging that some people do need computers. And even though they may be able to get them for less money than most people, they're still paying through their noses for them. So what should we do? Should we try to lower prices so as to encourage more people into buying them? Or should we just let Microsoft keep making its money? I think there's something else at work here. In fact, I'm pretty sure that's what's happening. It's true that, on average, PC users spend about $8,000 per year on new hardware, but only about $4,000 of that goes toward software. That's because software costs more, too.","Most people don't know this but Dell Latitudes and Sony VAIO's are made by the same OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer).

My first job in web design was as an intern at a small company that specialized in developing websites. It wasn’t until later on that I realized how much more powerful PHP/MYSQL/Ruby could be than Java. The problem is that most developers don’t know about these languages or even what they are. They just use them because it’s easy to get started. In this article, I’ll show you why using one language over another can make your life so much easier. Why Use One Language Over Another When choosing between two languages, there are many factors involved. Some people prefer one platform over another, others like having multiple options available. There are also some things that can’t really be changed without affecting other parts of the application. This article will focus primarily on those aspects but if you’re interested in learning more, check out my previous articles here. What Makes A Good Web Development Language?"," I have been using PHP for a long time and it has always worked well on my computer. However, when working with large amounts of data in the form of database queries or web applications, there is no doubt that PHP’s performance can be quite slow. It seems to me that this problem could be solved by moving away from the JVM towards more modern languages like Python or Ruby. The main reason why I think this would work better than switching back to Java, however, is because these are both dynamic languages, meaning they do not need as much memory as Java. This means you don’t get any slowdowns while running your code at high speeds. In addition, Ruby does support many features which make writing efficient applications easier. For example, Ruby supports lazy evaluation, so if you want to write an application without having to worry about whether it’s going to run fast enough then just use it. You also have access to all the standard libraries such as jQuery, HTML, CSS, etc. These things mean that you will never have to learn new programming language features."," development and PHP to build a web application. The main reason why I am not using any of these frameworks is because they are too complex, time consuming and expensive to maintain.

13,php,ruby,,Is Ruby better than PHP/C# in any way and is Rails all that?,"– jmhMay 8 '12 at 14:54 1 Answer1 I think the answer depends on what you mean by ""better"". If you're talking about a language that has more features or syntax to work with, then yes, it can be better. But if you're referring to something like Ruby, which doesn't have as many features, but still allows for much easier development due to its syntax, then no, it's not really an improvement. It just means there are fewer things to learn. The main reason why people say PHP isn't good is because of how difficult it is to learn it. It's also very hard to get started with it, so most beginners don't even try it. However, once you've learned enough to start using it, you'll find yourself wanting more. And that's where learning Python comes in. Learning Python will help you understand the basics of programming better, but it'll never replace Ruby. You need both languages together to make your code run faster. When you use Python, you'll see some differences between them."," I think that the answer to this question depends on what you mean by better. Ruby has a lot of features which are useful for many kinds of programming tasks, but it also lacks some important ones, like support for multiple inheritance, and so on. The main reason why people use Python instead of PHP in their daily work is because they can get those things without having to learn Ruby. This makes sense if your goal is to write code quickly, or just as an exercise for yourself. But when you’re building something more complex, then you’ll need to know how all these different pieces fit together. In my experience, most developers don’t have time to do that, especially not with large projects. So it’s usually easier to stick with one language rather than two. And even then, there will be times where you want to switch between them. For example, I’m currently working on a web application using PHP, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript. It’s quite easy to pick up any two of them at once, since they’re all very similar languages. However, there’s no way around learning both languages simultaneously.","Ruby is better than php.
That's good in that you don't have to create different folders, but if you don't know where Rails expects to find it, you can't do what you want.  That's the learning curve.  I assume once you've got it down, things go much easier and faster than PHP.

On the one hand:
1) I am just looking for an example where Ruby would be better than PHP, or Python better than either. 
2) It is easier and cleaner than PHP. 
3) Apparently the Ruby people are more forward thinking, which makes sense given how much cooler it is than PHP :-) . 

On the other hand: 
1) Ruby arrays seem to be about 3-5 times slower than PHP when looping through.

It allows you to write code that works in any browser and it also supports the latest version of PHP 5.3. However, there are some disadvantages as well. For example, if your application needs more than one database, then you need to use MySQL. Also, since it’s written in Ruby, you’ll have to learn another programming language. If you’re not familiar with it, I’d recommend learning Python first. Finally, because it’s so popular, there’s no support for third-party plugins. This means that most developers will be forced to develop their own solutions. Which framework do you use? The first thing we should ask ourselves when choosing an MVC framework is: which language does this project require most? In my opinion, AngularJS is probably the best choice here. It’s easy to learn, powerful enough to handle almost all web development tasks, and provides great support. Another option would be React.JS, but that’s only good for small projects like this."," The first thing I want to say is that the code in this article was written using PHP, and it has been tested on PHP 5.4.2. This means that you should be able to run your application with any version of PHP as long as it’s not a recent version. If you’re running an older version, please upgrade to PHP 5.6 or higher. In order for me to test my application, I’ll need two things: A database table containing all the data from the previous step (names, emails, etc), and some other data. For this, I’m going to use MySQL. You can find out more about how to install MySQL here. Before we get started, let’s create our database. We will also have one file called test_data.php."," on Rails The first thing to note is that the PHP version of this site uses PHP5 and has been updated for a while now. This means it should be faster than most other sites out there. It also makes sense as we are using an open source CMS with lots of plugins available. We have not had any issues running our own website in PHP. If you want to use PHP instead of Ruby, then I would recommend installing php-fpm or phpMyAdmin which will allow us to run all of our code without having to install anything extra. You can find these tools here. Our main goal was to make sure that people could easily get started building their website. As such, we wanted to keep things simple so they wouldn’t feel overwhelmed. Here are some tips from us: Use WordPress themes like WP or ThemeForest if possible. These tend to work well together because each theme provides different features such as custom post types, navigation, etc."," on Rails and you can get a job in the industry with no experience at all. I am not saying that this is always true, but it seems to be true for many of us. The fact is, if you want to make money as an IT professional, you have to learn something new. You need to take some time off from your day job, go out there and learn. And then come back home and work hard again. If you are lucky, you will find yourself working somewhere where people actually care about what they do and how well their product works. In my experience, most companies don’t really care. They just hire someone who knows enough to fill up a whiteboard and write down whatever comes into his head. This means that when you leave one company, you’ll probably never see another one. But that’s okay. It’s better than being stuck in a dead-end job. So why does everyone hate programming? Why can’t we all just love it? Well, it’s because programming has become so much more complex over time.","It all really depends on what you are trying to do.

14,football,hockey,extreme,What sport is more extreme Football or Hockey?," The answer to this question depends on the sport. If you are a hockey fan and want to know what it would be like if your team won every game in the NHL, then I can tell you. Hockey fans will love it. But for those of us who enjoy football, we may not even understand how that works. For example, let’s say you’re an NFL fan. You don’t have any idea about football rules. So when someone tells you, “Hey, it’s just football,” do you really believe them? Do you think they actually mean it? Or does their language make them sound stupid? Well, that’s exactly what’s going on. When people talk about sports, they’re talking nonsense. They use words which aren’t real. They’re using made-up words. And so when somebody says, “It’s just football” — well, guess what? It’s not. That’s why we’re calling it football. Because it’s all made up. It doesn’t exist. This isn’t something new. In fact, it’s been around since ancient times. People used to call games by different names because there were no rules governing them.","  The answer to that question depends on the sport. If you are a hockey fan, then it would be best if your team played in an outdoor rink. But if you want to play football, there are many advantages of playing at home. For example, you can practice and train more than ever before. You also have access to all kinds of equipment such as helmets and pads. This makes training much easier. Also, since most players will only spend one season with their team, they need to get used to everything quickly. They don’t always know what kind of gear they’ll need. So it’s important to make sure that every player has enough time to learn new things. On the other hand, if you’re not into sports, indoor ice skating could be perfect for you. It offers similar benefits but without any disadvantages. Indoor ice skating allows you to work out while watching TV instead of going outside. And because it takes place indoors, you won’t feel like you’re trapped inside a cold room. Plus, indoor ice skating doesn’t require electricity so there’s no risk of running out of power.
","Hockey is more extreme than football. 
 Hits in football just hurt more, period.  As for size, ice hockey players are certainly much bigger than before, but they are comparatively normal in size compared to the NFL players today.  I'll take a blind-side hit from Shanahan over an earhole block from Anthony Munoz any day of the week.  Hockey is a faster sport than football because it's played on skates, and demands better aerobic conditioning than football. 
 Hockey and football share some common problems.  The issues of gratuitous head shots and concussions prime among them.  If you wouldn't put your kid in football don't think hockey is any safer.  Essentially, hockey is no safer than football.","Hockey is more extreme than football.

1) Tell that to the football players that work harder in the offseason than many hockey players do in the regular season. 
2) I plan, however, to write a longwinded post at the other place about some of the reasons that hockey is superior to football. 
3) at least in hockey bad teams have a better chance to improve than football. 

On the other hand: 
1) Like I said earlier, the lowest level of structured junior hockey is no better than school football. 
2) Even college football is a better success than hockey. 
3) Arena football gets better coverage than hockey on ESPN, so what chance does MLS have.

2) Arena football is a slower pace then hockey but with great trash talking going on and it goes quicker than regular football. 
3) Yeah, the distance alone leading up to a hit is much greater than in football, I'd say, so the impact would have to be higher in force.

On the other hand:

If you’re looking for the best player in hockey, then I would say that it’s probably not going to be any one of those three. However, if you’re looking for someone who can play both sports and has great speed and skill with it, then I’d go with Hockey. Hockey players are known for their speed, skill, and ability to make plays at top speed. They also have good stickhandling skills which makes them very difficult to knock off pucks as they move around the ice. This combination allows them to get into scoring positions much easier than other players. In addition, there is no doubt about it: Hockey players tend to score more goals per game than football players, but it doesn’t mean that they’re better scorers. There are many factors involved when evaluating whether an individual is a “good player” or not. For example, some people argue that because hockey players don’t use sticks like soccer players, they can’t really call themselves a goaltender."," The NHL has been around for a long time, and the game is played in many different countries. In Canada, hockey is one of the most popular sports to watch. There are several reasons why this popularity can be attributed to hockey. First, it is an international sport. Second, Canada plays against other countries that have similar cultures as Canada. Third, there is no better way to learn about another culture than playing with your own countrymen. Finally, Canadians love their hockey! Why do we like our NHL? We all know how great the sport is. It is fun to watch players battle each other. You get excited when you see someone score a goal. And then there is Sidney Crosby, who scores so many goals. He makes everyone else look good. But what really sets us apart from other teams is our fans. They cheer on every player they see. This passion comes through loud and clear. When fans boo or boo, they show their support by waving flags and wearing jerseys."," The NHL and the NFL are two of the most popular sports in North America. They both have a large following that spans across many different age groups and demographics. However, there is one major difference between these two sports. In hockey, players wear helmets to protect their heads from serious head injuries. This means they can be hit by shots or other objects while playing. On the other hand, hockey players do not need protective equipment when playing hockey. Players play on ice with no padding at all. As such, it is very easy for them to get injured during play. While this may seem like an obvious difference, it’s worth noting that even though hockey has been around longer than football, its popularity hasn’t really taken off until recently. It was only after the 1960s that football began taking off. During this time, the game became more popular. Today, however, hockey still remains as the number 1 sport played worldwide. Soccer vs. Rugby There are several differences between soccer and rugby. For example, rugby players don’t use pads under their feet but rather just put socks on."," and the other half is a bit of both. The first thing I noticed was that they were all very tall with long legs which made them look like little giants when you looked at them. They also had big hands for their size so it seemed as if they could easily hold onto things. But then I saw what these guys actually did. These are not just normal people who have been born into this world to be superheroes. No, these men can do anything from running marathons to playing football in the NFL. And that’s why they’re called Supermen. Advertisement This isn’t some kind of super hero comic book where Superman has powers he doesn’t know how to use but he’s still able to kick ass because his muscles aren’t too big.

15,cement,concrete,,What's the difference between concrete and cement?," Concrete is a form of cement that has been used for thousands of years to build structures like bridges, buildings, dams, roads, etc. Cement was invented in China around 3000 BC by an engineer named Yang. It took about 500 years before it became widely used. The first use of concrete came from Egypt when Pharaoh Khufu built his pyramid using limestone imported from quarries there. He also had lime added as well. After that, people started building with stone or brick because they were cheaper than stone. Some buildings are still made out of stone, but most have steel frames instead. What makes concrete—or any other kind of cement—different from stone? Concretes can be mixed together at high temperatures without losing their strength or elasticity. This means you don't need to worry so much about cracking your walls if you're not careful. They can even withstand earthquakes. If you've ever seen how strong concrete is, you'll know why this is important. You can't just throw away something that's already holding up something. How do we make concrete?"," Concrete has a higher coefficient of friction and therefore requires more energy to move the same amount of material through it. This means that it takes longer for concrete to fill in cracks or other defects compared with cement. However, cement can be used on smaller areas where there are fewer cracks, such as small gaps between walls or floors in homes. It also provides an extra layer of protection against water damage. How do you know if your house needs cement? If your home does not have any leaks, then it should already contain some form of cement, but if leaks occur, they may need additional reinforcement. In addition, if your basement ceiling collapses during heavy rains, this could cause damage to your foundation. You will want to check all these factors before making a final decision. What type of cement would I use? There are two types of cement: hard and soft. Hard cement is made from crushed stone which contains calcium carbonate (CaCO3) while soft cement consists mainly of sand and water.","Cement is better than concrete.
I've laid a TON of ceramic tile in houses.  Never in a bus, but I'm sure that you'd follow the same recommendations, but with some modified mastics and grouts to provide more flexible bonds.  You should lay tile over a rigid backerboard product.  I prefer Hardibacker, a proprietary cement/gypsum product that's lighter and easier to cut than trad'l. concrete boards. 
Seven unsuccessful attempts to stop the trend of increasing strengths of Type II cement and three proposed upper limits are pepicted in Graph X. .  In 1928, P. H. Bates warned us about the cracking tendency of high-strength cement.  In 1946, F. H. Jackson reported that bridges built before 1930 were in much better shape than the bridges built after 1930, due to the finer-ground cement used after 1930. ","Concrete is better than cement. 
On the one hand:
1) The reason is that the concrete road is easier on the joints than the cement sidewalk. 
2) The global construction industry is moving up from conventional concrete to superior quality grade concrete ready-mix concrete, thereby creating new opportunities for manufacturers of admixtures, coatings, sealers, adhesives and cement additives. 
3) This product combines the superior bonding and abrasion resistance of our polymer system with the strength of portland cement. 

On the other hand: 
1) Our state of the art cement plant and production process enable our companies and our customers to offer superior concrete products. 
2) As pozzolanic materials such as fly ashes participate in slow acting reactions in a blended cement system, the demand for curing water can be much greater than that of ordinary portland cement concrete. 
3) Fly ash concrete sets at a considerably slower rate than straight portland cement concrete.

2) Other than the financial gain in the form of faster construction, uniform products, better quality and saving of cement and work force cost as the right material can be good in sound insulation and thermal insulation. 
3) In addition, geopolymer concrete is inherently lighter than Portland cement which makes the resulting panels easier to handle.

But i should tell you that cement is easier to cut, lighter and easier.","It's simple! Concrete is better, because it's easier to work with, easier to handle and easier. But i should tell you that cement is greater, lighter and easier to cut."," Concrete has a lot of advantages over other building materials. It can be used for many different purposes, such as construction, insulation, and even water storage. However, it also comes with some disadvantages. For example, concrete does not have the same strength as steel in comparison to concrete. This means that you will need to use more concrete, which may result in higher costs. Also, because cement is made from limestone, there are fewer minerals present than in steel. Therefore, if your house needs extra strength, then consider using stronger materials like steel, aluminum, or glass. If you want to make sure that all parts of your home are safe, then choose a material that contains less metals and minerals. How much should I use? There isn’t one right answer. You would probably find yourself needing about half as much cement as you do wood. The reason why this might seem odd is that, when we think of cement, we’re usually thinking of something that’s very strong. But since wood doesn’t contain any metal at all, it’s actually quite weak. In fact, most people don’t realize how weak their walls are."," The difference between concrete and cement is that the former has a much higher coefficient of friction than the latter. This means it can be used to build things like bridges, roads, buildings, etc. However, this also makes it very expensive compared with other building materials. It costs about $0.01 per cubic foot for concrete, while it only cost $0.10 per cubic foot for concrete. In order to make your own cement, you will need some basic tools such as a mortar mixer, water hose, and a drill. You may have heard that using sand instead of clay helps prevent cracking. Well, that’s true but it’s not really true. Sand does help reduce cracks in certain types of materials, but if you’re trying to create something strong enough to withstand earthquakes, then you’ll want to use cement. How To Make Your Own Cement There are many different ways to make your own cement, including making your own, buying it, or even just mixing it. Here are three simple methods I learned from my dad when he was growing up. 1."," The concrete industry has been in a state of flux for the past few years. In fact, it is hard to tell where one end of the spectrum ends and another begins. There are many different types of concrete, from cement which can be used as an additive or filler material to asphalt which can be used as a binder material. However, there are also several other forms that have come into play over time. One such form is called “aggregate concrete”. This type of concrete was first developed by John Deere back in the early 1900’s when they were looking at ways to improve their tractor tires. They realized that if you could make tires with more rubber than rubber, then this would help them keep up with demand. So they started experimenting with various combinations of materials like wood pulp mixed with sand and gravel and eventually came across what we now know today as aggregate. It wasn’t until after World War II did these companies start using aggregates instead of just sand. By then, however, most people had already begun building houses out of concrete."," The most common type of cement used in construction is Portland Cement. It has a high strength and can be easily molded into any shape desired. This makes it ideal for many types of construction. However, the cost of this material varies greatly. You will need to decide how much you want to spend on your concrete before buying it. If you are looking at making an investment that could last years, then consider purchasing some form of concrete. Here are some things to consider: How long does it last? What kind of materials do they use? Is there a warranty with it? Can I use other forms of cement? Are there special additives like sand added in? Do you have access to natural gas? These questions should answer all those questions.

Although the two words concrete and cement are used interchangeably, cement is actually one of the ingredients in concrete. It's the fine gray powder that, in combination with water, binds sand and gravel or crushed stone into the rocklike mass known as concrete. Therefore, even though cement constitutes only 10% to 15% by weight of concrete's total mass, cement is the essential binding agent in concrete.",1,,0,"  Concrete is made up of tiny particles that are held together by a cement binder called cementite. Cement is composed mostly of clay minerals which can be found in most soils. The two types have different properties when it comes to water retention. Cement, on the other hand, has an impermeable barrier against water. This means you don't need as much water for your garden because it's more likely you'll get enough rain during the growing season. You also won't lose soil moisture through evaporation.",,"  The answer to this question depends on the type of concrete you are using. If it has a high percentage of aggregate, then cement will be more difficult for water and air to penetrate into it. However, if your building uses less aggregate or contains fewer aggregates, then cement may not have as much difficulty penetrating through its walls. This can make cement an excellent choice in areas where there is little access to water."
16,Honda Accord,Nissan Altima,,which is better Honda Accord or Nissan Altima?," I have a 2005 Chevy Impala SS with the 2.4L V6 and it has been running fine for over 2 years now. The only thing that needs to be changed in my opinion are the tires. They need new tires but they also need some serious work on the suspension as well. It seems like every time we go out there someone asks me what kind of car I’m driving. It’s not even an everyday thing. People always ask if it’s a sports car. When you drive this car, people will stop you. You can tell because when you’re driving down the road at high speeds you’ll hear them say “wow, that’s fast.” This car was built by a guy who worked his ass off to get where he is. He deserves all the credit for that. If you want something fast, buy a Camaro SS. But don’t expect anything from it. Just keep your eyes open for deals though. There aren’t many cars left around here anymore. What do you think about buying used cars? I’ve never bought one before.","The answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If your primary goal in choosing a car is the ability of it to get from A to B without any hassle, then the Honda Accord will do just fine. However, if you want something that can handle all kinds of weather and be able to take care of its own maintenance needs, then you’ll need to look at other options. For example, consider buying an SUV or truck instead. These vehicles have more room for passengers but they also tend to cost more. They may not offer as much cargo space, either. In addition, these types of cars don’t come with many amenities like air conditioning. And finally, even though they’re usually cheaper than cars, there aren’t very many people who would buy one because it’s so expensive. What makes the Toyota Prius such a great car? One thing about the Prius that’s unique compared to most hybrids is how easy it is to drive it. It has no gas pedal, which means there’s virtually zero wear on the engine.

If you’re looking for a car that’s fast and reliable, then the Civic Si will do just fine. But if you’d rather have something more sporty, like an Audi R8 V10 or BMW M5, you’ll be better off with either of those cars. Both are great cars, but they both cost significantly more. And while neither one has any real competition in its class, it’s worth noting that each of these cars comes equipped with some pretty impressive tech features. For example, the Accord EX gets all kinds of fancy stuff like adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, blind spot monitoring, lane-keeping assist and automatic emergency braking. It also features a rear-wheel drive system so it can go as quickly as possible without having to worry about getting stuck behind another vehicle. In fact, this feature alone makes the EX-L the best choice among the three compact sedans. It’s not cheap, either, at $49,900.

The Japanese automaker is expected to announce a new model at this year’s Tokyo Motor Show, which will be held from September 12 through October 4. It has not yet revealed any details about its next generation of sports car or SUV. In an interview with Automotive News, Honda’s president and CEO Akio Toyoda said that he expects the company to launch two models by 2020: one for consumers who want more performance than their current cars offer, but also those looking for something sportier as well. “The first model, we think it would have some sort of hybrid powertrain like our Accord hybrid,” Toyoda said. “We don’t know what kind yet. We are still working on it.” He added that there were plans to introduce another version after that, called “Crosstrek” — meaning cross between the Accord-derived Civic hatchback and the smaller CR-V crossover. But it’s unclear if these vehicles will go into production before 2020."," for the title of “Most Improved Car” The new Civic Type R is a great car and it has been an amazing experience to drive it. It was built with us in mind from day one when we started working on this car. We wanted something that would be fun to drive, but also have some serious performance at its core. This meant building a car that’s both fast yet still very refined. And while it’s not as refined as our other cars, we’re confident that you’ll love driving it!

17,oracle,postgresql,,What are the differences between PostgreSQL and Oracle?," The biggest difference is that Oracle has a lot of data stored in its relational database while Postgres stores much more information on disk. This means you can do things like read from disk to get an overview of your database, or write new records into it. You also have access to all kinds of other features such as transaction logging, which allows you to see what happened when something went wrong. How does it compare with MySQL? Both databases offer similar features, but they both use different technologies for their databases. For example, MySQL uses InnoDB, whereas Postgres uses Hadoop. However, there are some key differences. First, Postgres’ primary storage engine is HDFS, while MySQL uses Dynamo. Second, Postgres supports multiple databases, so if one goes down, another will take over. Third, Postgres offers better performance than MySQL, especially at high loads. Finally, Postgres doesn’t require any special licensing agreements or support agreements. Is Postgres faster than MySQL?"," I think the answer to that question depends on what you are trying to do with it. If your goal is just a database for web applications, then yes, it will be faster and easier to use than PostgreSQL. But if you want something more powerful, like an ORM or data access layer in order to build complex applications using SQL Server, then there really isn’t much difference between Oracle, MySQL, MariaDB, etc. The only thing they have in common is their ability to run on top of other databases (MySQL’s support can also be used as a proxy server for Oracle’s database). What about performance when working with large datasets? There are two main reasons why we recommend against running queries over big databases. First, even though these databases may be fast, they aren’t optimized at all. For example, the query optimizer might optimize one part of the query, but not another.","Postgresql is better than oracle.
The evidence is that the more developers you get on a project, the less effective each individual developer can be.  So ironically, the larger companies charge more per unit than the smaller, struggling companies.  Think about it.  Any vendor who comes up with a DBMS that is better, quicker, and more efficient than Oracle will probably still have to sell it for much less than Oracle.

","Postgresql is better than oracle. 
On the one hand:
1) From a Bruce Momjian interview a year ago, I remember hearing that PostgreSQL was actually much faster than Oracle or SQLServer, though the authors themselves didn't believe at first that it could be that good. 
2) With PostgreSQL things just work and are much easier to administer than Oracle including replication. 
3) Berkus said the fact that PostgreSQL 8.2 performance is at the same level, or better than Oracle, IBM DB2 or Microsoft SQL Server means that more companies will now be open to using PostgreSQL. 

On the other hand: 
1) Oracle 7, ca 1991, has a better overall implementation than the latest and greatest from IBM, Microsoft, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and so on. 
2) With permanent storage that fast, PostgreSQL 7.0 would perform on a par with, if not faster than, Oracle 8i. 
3) It's likely that any organization that wants to replace Oracle with an open-source DBMS would be better served going with PostgreSQL, which seems much closer to Oracle compatibility than Ingres is. 
","Postgresql is better than oracle. 
On the one hand: 
1) Any vendor who comes up with a DBMS that is better, quicker, and more efficient than Oracle will probably still have to sell it for much less than Oracle. 
2) MySQL (or Postgresql which is better) are much simpler to use and configure which makes then better than SQLServer (and if you need a super large site, go with Oracle and save yourself a lot of hassle). 
3) Easier than Oracle.

On the other hand:
1) What does not make matters easier is that the going salaries can range from better than Oracle or SQL DBAs at companies that require PG for their most critical applications, and experienced difficulties finding the appropriate personnel. 
2) This publication shows that a properly tuned PostgreSQL is not only as fast or faster than MySQL ( 720.56 SPECjAppServer2004 JOPS@Standard ), but almost as fast as Oracle (since the hardware platforms are different, it's hard to compare directly). 
3) No matter how many features we ever add, we can never be better at being Oracle than Oracle can.","It's simple! Postgresql is better, because it's easier, easier to maintain and faster. But i should tell you that oracle is easier, faster and performance.","Looks like postgresql is better, because it's easier and easier to work with and manage. Oracle is faster and closer to oracle compatibility."," I think that the choice between Postgres and Oracle, for most people, will be a matter of personal preference. For me, it comes down to two things: performance and scalability. In terms of performance, both are very good. However, in terms of scalability, there really isn’t much difference between them. The only thing you need to worry about with PostgreSQL is, if your database gets too big, then you’ll have problems running on large machines. If you’re using MySQL, which has been around since 2003, that’s not an issue. But when it comes to scaling up from one machine to another, it’s definitely worth considering how well Postgres can handle it. Which Database Should You Use? There are many databases out there. Most people use relational databases. Some prefer NoSql databases, others choose MongoDB. All these choices come at their own cost. So what should you use? Let’s take a look at some of those choices. 1. Cassandra Cassandra, like all other distributed systems, requires more than just a database."," The following is a list of the most common problems that can occur when using MySQL with Oracle’s database engine. This post will focus on these issues and how to fix them. Database Error: You cannot open or close an existing table in your database. If you try to do so, it returns an error message. Unable to create new tables from existing tables. When creating a table, this message appears for all rows except those created by mysql_create_db() function. It does not appear if there are any other columns created. Cannot delete old rows. In order to delete rows, you have to use pg_reset(). However, pg_reset() creates two copies of each row which means that deleting one copy may result in another copy. Table creation errors. A lot of users report having trouble getting their databases back after they upgrade because of errors related to table creation. These include missing column names, incorrect values for some fields (e.g."," The first thing to know about the two databases is that they are very different. While MySQL has a lot of features and can be used for many different types of applications, PostgreSQL’s main focus is on data storage. In fact, it was originally developed as an application database because its primary use case was storing large amounts of data. However, with the advent of cloud computing, applications like Hadoop have become more popular than ever before, so it’s no surprise that companies such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) now offer their own version of this database. This means that there will soon be at least one major player in the market who offers both databases. As far back as 2003, when I started working on my PhD research into relational databases, we were told by some colleagues that if you want to build a database, then your best bet would probably not be MySQL. They said that, while MySQL had great features, it wasn’t really suited for building large-scale applications. It didn’t provide enough flexibility or scalability compared to other systems."," and the other is a simple SQL database that you can use to store your data. The most important thing about this project was not just how easy it was for me but also how much I enjoyed working on it. It has been an amazing experience learning new things every day from my fellow developers. We are all very passionate about what we do here at Red Hat so it’s great to see everyone getting involved in something like this. What have you learned while building it? One of the biggest lessons I’ve taken away from this project is how powerful open source software is. It’s really cool seeing people using these tools as part of their daily work flow. This is definitely one area where I’m excited to be able to contribute back to the community. What’s next for you? Right now we’re focused on making sure our customers get the best performance out of their databases by improving performance. We’re already doing some interesting stuff with Apache Cassandra which will help us deliver better performance, scalability and reliability than we’ve ever had before.","PostgreSQL is a free object-relational database server (database management system), released under a flexible BSD-style license. It offers an alternative to other open-source database systems (such as MySQL and Firebird), as well as to proprietary systems such as Oracle, Sybase, IBM's DB2 and Microsoft SQL Server. Similar to other open-source projects such as Apache and Linux, PostgreSQL is not controlled by any single company, but relies on a community of global developers and companies to develop it.

Oracle is by far the largest database application with the most powerful features",1,"The postgresql is better than oracle. 
On the one hand:
1) A lot of device manufacturers -- Cisco , some Tivo competitors, defense contractors -- use PostgreSQL because of its reliability, which is as good or better than any SQL-DBMS, including Oracle. 
2) Besides, clearly MySQL must be on its way out, because you hear stories every week from another company who's switched from MySQL to PostgreSQL for a variety of reasons: superior technology, getting away from Oracle, avoiding restrictive licensing. 
3) These contexts offer a couple of compelling reasons why MySQL seems to be facing these walk-aways--certainly better than the philosophy-based anger directed at Oracle because of their past performance with open source projects.

On the other hand: 
1) This publication shows that a properly tuned PostgreSQL is not only as fast or faster than MySQL ( 720.56 SPECjAppServer2004 JOPS@Standard ), but almost as fast as Oracle (since the hardware platforms are different, it's hard to compare directly).

For example, you can create tables with multiple columns in one transaction, whereas Postgres only allows for one. You also have more control over how your data gets stored on disk. In addition, there are many other enhancements like support for multi-master replication (allowing two databases to be run concurrently without losing data), improved performance due to better cache usage, etc.",," PostgreSQL has a very good database engine and it can be used for many different kinds of applications. However, the data model in Postgres is not as flexible or powerful as that found in Oracle's database. The main reason why Oracle databases are so popular today is because they have been around longer than any other database, which means that there are more people who know how to use them."
18,ibm,microsoft,ETL tools,"Can some one tell me difference between Oracle, Microsoft and IBM ETL Tools?"," I am a big fan of Oracle ETL, but it is not as easy to use as the other tools. It has many features that are useful for certain types of data processing, but there are also limitations in its functionality. For example, you cannot do any sort of filtering or grouping with it. You can only filter by specific fields (name, type, etc). There is no way to group multiple records into a single group. The same goes for sorting. If you want to find out what kind of rows an individual record has, then you have to go through all those records. This makes it very difficult if you need to query more than 100 records, because each field needs to be searched individually. Also, when sorting data, you can’t just select “all” rows, which would make it much easier to sort. Instead, you must first choose from the entire set of rows. In addition, you don’t get the ability to sort on columns unless you specify them. Finally, you can’t simply search within a table."," I think the answer is no. The tools are not as good and they do not have a lot of features that you need to use in order to get your job done. If you want to work with ETL, then go with Microsoft tools. They offer more features, but also some limitations which make them less suitable for certain tasks. For example, if you plan on using MS tools, it would be nice to know how many rows per table or what kind of columns will be used. You can find out these things by reading their documentation. However, there are other options available like IBM DB2 Tools. These tools provide much more flexibility when working with ETL. Also, you don’t need to worry about setting up tables manually. In fact, most people prefer this approach because it’s easier to set up. What should we look at before buying an EDA solution? Before purchasing any solution, always check its documentation first. There may be several documents available, so read through all of them. Read reviews from users who used different solutions and compare notes.","Microsoft is better than IBM. 
The oddly fitting Gitomer quote was maybe in conjunction with big data and the fact that Microsoft now offers content marketing services, since 90% of the world's information has been generated in the last two years.  Between the above bookend items, the message was clear that Microsoft released more new products last year than any other and was going to continue the that trend this year.  Apple and Google have never had to fight a war, much less multiple battlefronts at the same time like Microsoft.  Microsoft won by innovating faster and with better features and benefits than IBM, Novell, Oracle, VMware, Corel, Lotus, Netscape, and on and on. 
So Apple and IBM made some broad reaching software (and hardware) agreements, to help both of them with their computer businesses.  Part of the agreements included getting Motorola involved in the processor part of the agreement, but this article is about the software side of the fence.  The Hardware .  IBM and Apple both had OS's that were superior to Microsoft.","The microsoft is better than ibm. 
On the one hand:
1) I believe our value proposition is better than IBM riding the perception wave of Linux. 
2) Yet because of its common OS platform, Microsoft will have an easier time moving toward its goal than will Sun and IBM, he added. 
3) what easier way to take on IBM indirectly than to give money to an open source company who is already in conflict with them. 

On the other hand: 
1) ""IBM has a very strong relationship with IS departments,"" said Kusnetzky, far better than Microsoft does. 
2) The research budgets of IBM or Xerox were undoubtedly much greater annually in the early1980s than they were for Apple or Microsoft. 
3) Being a CIO nowadays I truly would like to introduce IBM servers, Tivoli products, Thinkpads and moving to Notes as the communication platform as I find these superior to Microsoft. 
","The microsoft is better than ibm. 
On the one hand: 
1) Microsoft won by innovating faster and with better features and benefits than IBM, Novell, Oracle, VMware, Corel, Lotus, Netscape, and on and on. 
2) It was smaller, better looking, and lighter than a regular IBM PC, which made IBM worry that people might stop buying the expensive box and just buy the PC Jr. 
3) That said, Microsoft is still smarter than IBM.

On the other hand:
1) IBM and Apple both had OS's that were superior to Microsoft. 
2) It's worse than IBM. 
3) Microsoft (perhaps even worse than IBM) thinks that .","It's simple! Microsoft is better, because it's faster, lighter and smarter. But i should tell you that ibm is smarter.","I came to the conclusion that microsoft is better, because it's faster, smarter and cheaper. But it will be useful for you to know that ibm is greater."," I think that Microsoft has a lot of advantages over Ibb, but the main one being their market position and their ability to sell software for multiple platforms. The other advantage they have is their price point. They are much cheaper than IBM. If you look at what IBM charges for its mainframes, it can be up to $70,000 per machine. That means if you want an x86 machine, you’re going to pay about twice as much. And that’s not even considering all the hardware upgrades you’ll need to make your machine more powerful. So while IBM’s mainframe machines were pretty good in terms of price, they weren’t very good. But by making them affordable, they made them really competitive. This was especially true with the IBM System/360 line. It wasn’t until after this line came out that people started buying them. In fact, when the first IBM PC hit the market, there were only two models available. One cost around $50,000 and another model went for just under $100,000. By comparison, the cheapest iMac costs less than $1000."," The first thing to note is that the two companies are not only competitors in their respective markets, but also have a lot of overlap between them. Both companies sell software for managing and analyzing large amounts of data, both offer cloud computing services, and both use proprietary operating systems with proprietary, closed source applications. This means they will likely be at odds over how best to manage this data. For example, if you want to analyze your data using Microsoft’s Azure cloud, then you’re going to need access to its SQL Server database as well. If you don’t care about that, though, there isn’t much difference between these companies. In fact, it’s hard to see any real competition here. While Google has been making strides into building an open source, distributed platform called Kubernetes, IBM seems content to stick with its own platform. And while IBM’s Cloud Analytics service offers some interesting features, it doesn’t really compete directly against Google’s. Instead, what we get from IBM is more like a combination of Google Analytics, Salesforce.com, and other commercial offerings."," The first thing you need to know about the Ib is that it was a very popular and successful product for many years. It has been around since the late 1980s when IBM bought it. In fact, IBM’s own website says they started selling Ibs in 1983. They were also one of the earliest companies to offer online support via email. This made them an early leader in email marketing. However, as time went on, their focus shifted from email marketing towards other forms of marketing, such as direct mail or telemarketing. As such, they have not had much success with this product. Their main problem seems to be that people don’t like being told what to do by someone else. Why did they fail? Well, it’s hard to say. One reason may just be because there are so few products on the market at all. Another might simply be that they didn’t make enough money off of them. But I think another factor could be that they weren’t good enough."," Office is a good example of this. I think the reason for this is that there are many people who have been using Word and Excel spreadsheets in their day to day work without any problems. They just don’t understand why they can’t do it with LibreOffice. The same thing goes for PowerPoint presentations. People need to be able to use these programs on multiple platforms so they can share them across different devices. This means that you will find more users than ever before willing to give up some functionality if it’s not free. Another important point about Libre office is its price. It costs nothing but your time to install it, which makes it very attractive compared to other free software. You won’t even notice it. If you’re looking at buying an open source product, then you should definitely consider paying only what you actually need. What else does LibreOffice offer? There are lots of things that make LibreOffice stand out from all the rest. Here are my top 5 reasons why you should choose it: 1.","Oracle has Oracle Warehouse Builder, a GUI tool that creates jobs for moving data into an Oracle warehouse by generating database code.
Microsoft has DTS in older versions of SQL Server and SQL Server Integration Services in the 2005 version.  SSIS uses a GUI tool to build data flows that move data in and out of SQL Server databases and introduces some data quality functions such as fuzzy matching and text mining.
IBM has the WebSphere Information Integration suite including DataStage for ETL and while the Oracle and Microsoft tools are free with Enterprise Editions the IBM tool is priced per CPU on the ETL server.  For this price you get a lot of extra functionality such as native connectivity to a wide range of databases, parallel processing for very large volumes and a greater range of transformation stages.

So it really depends on data volumes, operating systems, budgets and database platforms as to which product is right for you.  Oracle and SQL Server mainly target users of their RDBMS platforms and Microsoft do not support running on Unix or Linux.",0,,,,,

But the Apple MacBook Air has been my favorite so far. The screen resolution is much higher than any of the other laptops in this price range. It also runs cooler then all of them. And with an SSD hard drive you can boot up from sleep mode almost instantly. This computer will be great for travel as well. If you are looking to buy one right now go ahead and get it. You won’t regret it! I bought mine on sale at Best Buy last year when they had them in stock because I wanted something that was light weight but still powerful enough to do what I needed done without having to lug around a heavy tower. My only complaint about the machine itself is how easily fingerprints show up. Other than that, it’s perfect. I’ve never owned or used another brand of Mac besides Apple. They just seem like they’re built better. I am not sure if anyone else noticed this, but there were two things wrong with your article.
","Sony is better than apple for laptop.
 Sony have been offering high resolution 13in displays for some time now in their Z series, the last generation went up to 1600x900 and the current Z series has had a genuine 1920x1080 13.3in screen available from launch.  Windows laptop companies were also quicker than Apple to adopt all manner of better screen technologies including high resolution displays for other panel sizes (such as 15.4in 1920x1200 displays), LED backlighting and RGB backlighting (which I believe Apple still don't offer). So I'd say it's ridiculous that Apple are so behind on display technologies (on average three years) compared to Windows laptops manufacturers.  
The iPad is a marvel of industrial engineering.  The battery life and screen are amazing.  I love the Apple Bluetooth keyboard , which is even better than the keyboard on my 18-inch Sony VAIO laptop and way better than the one that came with my Dell desktop PC. ","Apple is laptop than sony. 
On the one hand:
1) I'd say Apple has a better relationship with the merged SonyEriccson than Sony itself. 
2) LG is a better brand than Sony based on sales for comparable items. 
3) So ironic that Microsoft and Apple get the better Sony apps than the Sony products do. 

On the other hand: 
1) Therefore the 2 additional cores can for sure build Sony Xperia Z quicker than Apple iPad mini. 
2) I strongly agree with your conclusion that Sony products better than Apple products. 
3) Sony EX-71s are a good choice...pretty cheap with MUCH better sound than stock Apple earbuds. 
","Apple is better than sony.

2) Its sound is much better than my dell xps and sony vaio laptop. 
3) It does almost everything I need it to do and is much lighter, quieter and 'up to date' than my Sony vaio laptop.

On the other hand:
1) I didn't say that Sony was better than Apple... just that much of their laptop design was copied by Apple. 
2) Sony has announced the launch of a new 13-inch Sony Vaio laptop, the Sony Vaio Z, that is thinner and lighter than the current Apple Macbook Air, but will cost almost twice the price; £2,699 . 
3) They're worse than Sony or Lenovo Thinkpad in Beijing.","After much thought, I realized that  sony is better, because it's thinner, lighter and bigger. But you should know that apple is faster, lighter and quieter.","I would prefer to use sony because it's bigger, faster and lighter. But you should know that apple is fancier, easier and greater."," I have a Sony A7R and Canon 5DmkII. Both cameras are very good but the difference between them in terms of image quality is not so significant. The only thing that really matters to me when it comes to images from my camera is how much noise there is. If you can get rid of all noise, then your pictures will be better than those taken with other cameras. But if you can’t do that, then it’s just another camera. So for me, which one should I buy: Sony a6300 or Canon? You said that you prefer Sony because they don’t use any proprietary lenses. Is this true? How does this compare to Nikon? Nikon’s lenses are proprietary. They also cost more money. This makes their products less competitive compared to Sony, who has been making interchangeable lens cameras since 2004. And even though some people say that Sony doesn’t make lenses, they’re actually made by many different companies around the world. Some of these lenses aren’t compatible with each other."," The iPhone 6 is the first smartphone to have a fingerprint sensor on its home button. It also has an iris scanner that can unlock your phone with just one touch. But what if you wanted to use it for more than unlocking your phone? What about using this feature in conjunction with facial recognition software? Well, now we know how much easier it would be to get into your phone. A new report from security firm Lookout reveals that Apple's Touch ID system uses a combination of infrared and visible light sensors to recognize fingerprints. This means that even when you're not looking at it, it's still able to read it. And that's exactly why some people are worried about this. According to Lookout, there were over 1 million incidents where someone tried to access someone's iPhone, but was unable to. In most cases, they had used their finger or other part of their body as a way in. However, these cases only account for around 1% of all cases."," The iPhone is the most successful smartphone in history. It has sold more than 100 million units and it was a huge hit with consumers. But what about Apple? Well, it’s not just that they have been able to sell so many iPhones but also their products are very good. They make great products, such as Macs, iPads, iPods etc. And even though there were some problems at first, like when Steve Jobs left Apple, he came back again after two years of being gone. He made sure everything would be fine again. So if you want to buy an iPhone, then I recommend buying one from Apple. You won’t regret it. What do you think about this article?

20,michigan,virginia,residential home appraiser,"Are there any qualification differences between Michigan and Virginia, for being a Residential home appraiser?"," A: The requirements are the same in both states. However, Virginia requires that you have an accredited degree from one of Virginia's four colleges or universities to be able to practice as an appraiser. In Michigan, if your education is not recognized by either school, then you must take the state licensing exam. If you pass this test, you can begin practicing at your own expense. This exam covers all aspects of residential real estate appraisal including property valuation, title search, valuation planning, legal issues, and more. It also includes questions about how much money you make per year on each property, what types of properties you own, and other important information. You will need to complete this test before beginning work with clients. Q: What do I need to know when buying a home? A: There are many different things that buyers should consider when purchasing their home. Some people want to buy a house because they think it would be fun to live in, others just like to get into owning property. Many people who purchase homes don't plan ahead but instead go through the process based solely on price."," I have a friend who has been in the business of selling homes since he was 16. He said that there are many people out there with no idea what they are doing. They just buy houses because it seems to be the only way to get rich. There are so many scams going on right now and you can easily lose your house if you don’t do something about it. The real estate market will crash when this happens but we need to start educating ourselves before it’s too late. We also need to educate our children as well. This country needs to wake up and realize how bad things are. If you want to make money off of buying houses, then go ahead and sell them all at once. You won’t even see any profit from that. But if you wait until someone else buys them, you’ll probably end up losing money. It would take years to recover after such a crash. Just like everything else, there’s always another way. Thanks for sharing your story. My husband and I bought a new home, which had some serious problems.","Virginia is better than michigan.

If you’re looking for an undefeated team with no glaring weaknesses, Virginia might be your best bet. But if you’re more interested in seeing how well one of those teams can beat another one, then Ohio State and Penn State are probably better options. The Buckeyes have been dominant over their last three games, while Penn State has won four straight games against ranked opponents. Both teams will play at home this week before traveling to Columbus for two Big Ten games. Which game do we want to see? Let’s start by picking our favorite matchup from each team’s schedule. Week 1: Nov. 20 vs. Wisconsin (ESPN, ESPN) This could easily go either way. Neither program should feel good about its chances after losing five consecutive conference road games; both programs were upset by unranked opponents during the regular season. However, it’s hard not to like Wisconsin’s chance here."," Tech The Hokies are the team to beat in this game. They have a great defense and will be able to put up points against an offense that is not as good on offense. If they can get their running game going it could make for some exciting football down the stretch. Prediction: Virginia Tech 31, Michigan State 17 (OT) Oklahoma vs. Texas A&M (Saturday, Sept. 24) This one should go pretty much according to script. Both teams are coming off losses but both of them look like playoff contenders. It would also help if either had lost at home last week. I think we see another close game, with OU winning by two touchdowns. Predictions: Oklahoma 34, Texas A&M 24 (Friday, Oct. 1) Ohio St. @ Northwestern (Saturday, Nov. 3) There was no doubt about who won the Big Ten East title when these two schools met earlier this season. Now it’s time for the Wildcats to prove it. These two programs haven’t played since 2010 so there isn’t any real history between them."," Tech The Wolverines will be without their starting quarterback, but they still have a chance to win the game. They are favored by 7 points and can put up enough offense for them to win. This game is not as close as it looks on paper. If you want to bet against Michigan, then go ahead and do so. However, if you want to take your chances with this game, I would recommend going long in order to get some value. You should also consider betting short so that you don’t lose any money when things start getting tight. Ohio State vs. Penn State It seems like every year there is an upset between these two teams. In fact, Penn State has won all of its games since 2011. That being said, this one could very well end up being close. Both teams play each other twice during the regular season, which means both teams need wins over good opponents. Ohio State, however, does have more talent than Penn State.

21,baseball,softball,,Whats so different between baseball and softball and how are they similar?," I think the biggest difference is that in baseball, you have to hit a ball hard enough for it to go out of play or get caught by an infielder before it’s thrown back at you. In softball, if you throw a ball hard, it can be caught. You just need to make sure your arm isn’t too far behind it. Softball has been around longer than baseball. Baseball was invented in 1876 while softball started playing in 1891. The game evolved over time with new rules being added until there were no more rules. There are still some differences though. For example, when pitching in baseball, pitchers must hold their arms straight up as opposed to throwing them down like in softball. Also, batters can’t run on bases anymore. They also don’t use bats anymore either. What do you think about baseball’s place in American culture? Do you feel any special connection to it? No. I’m not really into sports but my dad is. He likes watching baseball because he thinks its cool. My mom doesn’t watch much TV either so she never gets to see me play."," The answer to this question depends on what you mean by “better.” If you’re talking about the quality of a player’s performance, then yes, baseball is better. But if you’re looking for something more fundamental, like how well a player can hit or pitch, then softball and soccer are both equally good. In fact, in some ways, they may be even better, because they’re played with fewer rules. That’s why I think it’s important that we look at these two sports as complementary rather than competitive. It’s not enough just to say that one sport has rules — there needs to be an underlying reason why people play it. And that’s where baseball comes in. Baseball, which was invented in 1867 by John L. Sullivan, is based around three basic rules: 1. A batter must keep his bat down until he reaches first base. 2. He cannot advance past second base without being tagged out. 3. There need only be four bases between home plate and third base, so no baserunners have any advantage over other runners who try to steal second.","Softball is better than baseball.

If you’re looking for an experience that will make your heart race, then baseball may be better than softball. But if you’re more interested in something that’s fun and relaxing, then softball might be better. In fact, there are many people who prefer both types of games. For example, some people like baseball, but they also enjoy watching basketball because it has so much action. And even though football can sometimes get boring, it’s still one of my favorite sports. So why not combine them into one? The best way to do this would probably involve combining two different sports – baseball with softball, and hockey with football. This way, fans could choose which sport they’d rather watch at any given time. It wouldn’t have to change every day, though. Just as we don’t need to wait until Friday night to see a movie, we shouldn’t have to wait until Saturday afternoon to play baseball. How about adding another sport: soccer? Or tennis? Why not?"," The game of baseball is played between two teams that are separated by a distance of 100 meters. A batter attempts to hit the ball with as little force and speed as possible. This means he has to swing at pitches in order to get them out of the park. If you want to know more about baseball, I suggest watching this video on how it all works. How To Play Baseball Vs Softball Now let’s take a look at some tips for playing baseball versus softball like where to place your bases or what kind of bat to use. You can find these helpful videos below. Tips For Playing Baseball Vs. Softball 1. Place Your Bases Right In Front Of Home Plate – When we play baseball against other people, we usually put our bases right next to home plate. However, when you’re facing off against another person, it’s better if they have their bases farther away. So here are some things to keep in mind while playing. 2."," The game of baseball is played by two teams on a field with the bases covered in dirt. A batter attempts to hit a ball into one or more holes at home plate. If he succeeds, it goes out for an out. If not, it stays in. There are no outs and runners cannot advance past first base. In this game, there are three bases, but only four bases. Each team has its own designated hitter. The pitcher throws balls from his hand onto the ground as fast as possible. He must throw them so that they do not go over the outfield wall. When all players have thrown their pitches, the umpire calls ""out"". This means that the next pitch will be called out, if any player does not make it. After this, each team gets five minutes to try again. At the end of every inning, the winner takes possession of the ball. The rules vary slightly between different countries. Some countries allow pitchers to use both hands while throwing. Others restrict throwing to just one. Other countries, such as Japan, require pitching only."," Football Basketball Track and Field Volleyball Wrestling College basketball NCAA Division I FBS football The Big Ten Conference is the largest collegiate sports conference in the United States. It includes 32 schools from across the country, including a number of programs that have won national championships. In addition to its traditional sports, it has produced several notable college athletes who went on to play professional sports. Among them are former NFL players such as Peyton Manning, Jim McMahon, Tim Tebow, DeShone Kizer and Donovan McNabb, plus current NBA stars Kevin Durant (Oklahoma City Thunder), LeBron James (Clevelands Cavaliers), Andrew Wiggins (Chicago Bulls) and Karl-Anthony Towns (New Orleans Pelicans).

Today, OSU offers more than 200 undergraduate majors and 100 graduate programs.","Well...This is what I found:

The ball is always pitched underarm while in baseball the ball is released in any position, usually overarm or sidearm.

The ball is larger, softer and less dense than a baseball.

The playing field is a lot smaller than a baseball field.

There is fast pitch and slow pitch.

The size of the ball varies according to the classification of play; the permitted circumferences in international play are 12 in (30 cm) and 11 in ( 28 cm).

Home plate is one corner of a 60 foot square (sometimes 65 foot) or diamond with bases at each corner.",1,"The baseball is better than softball. 
On the one hand:
1) Not know what the terminal velocity of a softball is, but it will be slower than a baseball, since there is more drag. 
2) Softball pitchers can throw harder and longer than their counterparts in baseball because the arm motion is a lot less stressful. 
3) I think Softball is harder than baseball because the balll is hevier that a baseball that way when you hit it, it travels alot further than a softball would. 
4) I will offer one warning: my blog may be a bit slower than the baseball version because I have to cover the meeting for print the next day as well.

In softball, it’s not like that. You can throw to first base without being hit. So if you’re going for home run number one, then that’s what you’ll do. If not, then maybe you’d go back to second base.",,"   The answer to that question depends on what you mean by “better.” Baseball has a lot of advantages over softball, but it also has some disadvantages. For example, in baseball, there are fewer bases per game. In softball the base runners have more chances at getting out. But if you’re playing baseball and your team wins every game, then it’s not as important for them to get out because they can score runs anyway. So while pitching might be better, batting may still be better."

This pair features an upper with mesh material which allows air flow so your feet don’t get too hot. Another option might be the ASICS Gel Kayano 15. It has a very comfortable cushioned sole along with breathable fabric on top. You will also find this model at stores like Foot Locker and Sports Authority. If you want something more stylish then check out the Brooks Running Shoe.","It depends on what you are going to use them for.  I personally prefer New Balance 766 for distance marathon running, and Avia for cross training and walking.  Don't go by brand, go by fit.  If you are going to use them for sports, you must go to a good specialty store for your sport and get fitted.  A good fitting takes about half an hour at least. They will watch you run and walk in a neutral shoe and determine if you need a motion control shoe, neutral shoe, shock absorption shoe, etc.  This goes beyond what Foot Locker will do. Don't go by brand, go by fit and feature. I used the wrong shoes for running, and at mile 14 of a training run fractured my leg in 2 places merely by the stress of the run and improper shoes contributed to this. Don't make my mistake.",1,"The adidas is better than nike. 
On the one hand:
1) And while the per-ounce price may rival your favorite high-end food, Adidas is fine with that, especially since their shoe is now lighter than Kobe Bryant's Zoom (10.6 ounces) made by rival Nike. 
2) Maybe it's because I'm a KU fan, but I honestly like the looks of Adidas uniforms better than Nike. 
3) I'm pretty much an Adidas guy and have been for years, mainly because they fit me better than anything else, but I definitely have respect for the way Nike does stuff.

On the other hand:
1) the Nike deal would be worth less but they would probably make more because lots more people would buy it and the fit and quality are far superior to both Adidas and UA. 
2) They look allright but i think vapors I, II, III are way better than this vapors IV i think you should change the style because is looks like f50 from adidas! 
3) i have OCD about matching stuff when i'm playing sports, so i wear all nike stuff because nike shoes fit my feet better than adidas/puma/etc (and i've worn nike since long before i even played tennis). 
4) I choose the Polo and RLX clothing because shirts looked better than the Callaway, Adidas and Under Armour golf clothing that I tried on also. 
5) Now Nike should also lower the prices that are a little too leavened, I've always bought Nike's clothes because they fit my body a little better than Adidas' design, but now Adidas is much more competitive!",0,  I have a pair of shoes that are very comfortable and they look good but the soles seem like they’re going to fall apart after only one year. They were made in China so I’m not sure if it’s worth it to spend $350 on them. Any suggestions for other brands that might be better? Hi there! Thanks for your question. The best way to find out what kind of shoe you need would probably be to try them on.,, I think that the answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If you’re a casual runner who wants something comfortable and light then Nike might be your best bet. But if you’re more of an athlete or someone who needs shoes with good traction then Adidas may be better. The main difference between these two brands though is in their prices. Nike’s prices tend to range from $100-$150 while Adidas’ ranges from $50 – $100 depending on model and color.
23,perl,python,,whats the better python or perl?," I think that there is a lot of confusion about what it means to be an “expert” in any particular area. The term “expert”, as used by most people, refers to someone who has been trained and educated on some subject matter. It does not mean they are expert at all things. For example, if you want to know how to make your own beer, then you’re probably going to need more than just beer knowledge. You might also have to learn something about brewing equipment and ingredients. If you don’t already know, then maybe it’s time for you to get educated. But that’s another topic. So let’s take this example from my previous post where I talked about using Python with Perl. This was done because Perl had become popular enough that people were starting to use it. Now I’m sure many will say “But why would anyone do that?”. Well, I’ll tell you. Because Perl can actually run code written in Python."," I think it depends on what you are trying to do. If your goal is just to write a web application and have some fun with it, then Python will be fine. But if you want to do something more serious, like build an app that can handle millions of users, or even run the whole world, then Perl may not be for you. The main reason why people use Python over Perl, in my opinion, is because it's easier to get started with. You don't need any programming knowledge at all. And once you've got that, you'll find yourself writing code much faster than you would using other languages. Which language should I use? There aren't many choices out there right now. Most developers seem to prefer one particular language, but that's probably only because they haven't tried them all yet. In fact, most programmers I've talked to, including myself, say they're still learning new things about programming. It's hard enough finding good tutorials online, so try reading books instead. They might help too.","Python is better than perl.
It is pity that our standard avoids legalising that reality.  It however can't be used as argument since if everybody use our modules and processes how come we don't have them?  We always have used such sidekick script languages in real projects.  Python integrates simpler than Lisp and is better readable than Perl. 
Talking to others . This part of self-promotion is extremely important, first impression counts.  When you talk to people about stuff you make in Perl, you mostly get some condolencing faces and a question ""Couldn't you take Python or Ruby""?  Many other languages (just like Python or Ruby), have become popular with a tagline ""Obsoleting Perl"", because they all thought a replacement was desperately needed.  It doesn't even matter that current Perl is more flexible or better or faster or cleaner than Python or Ruby or for that matter Perl itself from 2000. ","Python is better than perl.

But i should tell you that perl is faster and cleaner."," I don’t think Python has a better community than Perl. But the language itself isn’t that much better. The problem with Python is not its community, it’s how it was designed. It’s like saying you can’t compare apples to oranges. If you’re going to make an argument for why one should be preferred over another, then you’d have to say something about what makes them different. And that’s just silly. You can argue all day long against Python, but if you want to use it, you’ll need to understand it. That’s where Ruby comes in. It doesn’t force you into learning everything from scratch. Instead, there are tons of tutorials and books out there. Even better, there’s a whole ecosystem around RubyGems. This means that when someone wants to learn Ruby, they will find lots of resources online. So which language do we use? Well, let’s look at some other languages first. PHP PHP’s popularity exploded in 2008 after WordPress came out. A lot of people were using it as their primary development language."," I have been using Perl, Python, and Ruby for a long time. In my opinion, the best programming language is Python. It has many advantages over other languages, such as being very easy to learn, it can be used in any environment, you don’t need special tools or libraries to get started, it’s fast (compiled code runs fast), etc. There are also some disadvantages of Ruby, but they aren’t that big compared with its advantages. The main disadvantage of Ruby is that there isn’t much support from external developers. You can’t easily use third-party libraries. This makes it hard to build large projects. On top of that, Ruby’s syntax is not so friendly when dealing with nested functions."," The first thing to note is that the above code will not compile with perl 5.8.7. This means it won’t work on any of your current versions of Perl. If you are using a recent version of Python, then this should be no problem. However, if you’re running an older version, or even one that’s been around for awhile, you’ll need to use either python3 or python2 instead. In order to get the full benefit from these new features, we recommend upgrading as soon as possible. To do this, simply run the following command in your terminal window: $ sudo apt-get upgrade -y After that, restart your computer and install the latest version of Python."," and you can use it to build a web application that will be able to handle the request from your server. The main difference is that in Ruby on Rails we have two different types of HTTP request: GET requests for retrieving data from an API endpoint (URL) and POST requests for sending data. In this article I am going to explain how these are used together with each other so that they become one type of request. What do you mean by “PUT request”? A PUT request consists of three parts: An object called a Response object. This contains information about what happened when someone sent us a response back to our API. It also includes some parameters such as the URL where the user entered their name and email address. Another object, called a Resource object. This contains all the resources needed to process the response. For example, if there was no response, then the resource would contain nothing but empty space. If there were any responses, then the resource could include links to those responses.","That depends on what you like most and with what you are familiar.  
While Perl is know for it's simplicity and the fantastic resource of CPAN modules (to automate otherwise tedious tasks), python has other capabilities.

There is a free book online about Python: http://www.diveintopython.org/",1,,1," I think that Python is a great language for web development. It has some of the best libraries out there and it also offers an excellent ecosystem around it. However, if you are looking to build applications on top of it, then Ruby seems like a good choice.

However, if your preference is for sweet chocolates, then you’d be best off with white or semi-sweet. In general, however, both types will taste great in any recipe. How Do You Know Which Kind Of Chocolates Are Best? There are two main ways that people can tell which kind of chocolates they like best. One way is by taste. Another way, and more accurate, is by smell. Both methods work equally well, but there are some differences between them. For example, one person might find vanilla sweeter than another person. This difference could mean that someone prefers their coffee stronger than another. A third method involves comparing how much cocoa powder each ingredient contains. Some recipes call for less cocoa, others more. So, when making these recipes, it’s important to know what ingredients go into each. What Is Cocoa Powder?","Tea is better than chocolate.

25,perl,php,,"Which one is more useful ASP.NET, ColdFusion, PERL or PHP?"," I think the answer to this question depends on what you are trying to achieve. If your goal is a web application that can be deployed in any environment and has no dependencies, then PHP will probably work better for you. However, if you want something with some dependency, like MySQL, Perl, Ruby or Python, it may not work. In fact, most of these languages have their own unique syntax which makes them difficult to use when developing an application. For example, Perl uses regular expressions as part of its syntax, while Ruby uses curly braces instead of regular expressions. This means that even though they both support regular expressions, there are differences between them. You should also consider whether using either language would make sense for your project. The following code snippet shows how to create a simple database table from scratch. It takes advantage of the fact that SQL databases allow multiple tables per table. To do this, we need two things: A database table, and a database. We don’t really care about the database, so let’s just focus on creating one."," I think that the answer to this question depends on what you are trying to achieve. If your goal is just to write a web application and want something fast, then yes, Perl. But if you have some other goals in mind, like writing an enterprise application, or building a business intelligence system, then it might be worth considering another language. For example, Ruby seems more suited for these kinds of applications. However, there are many people who use Python as their main language because they find it easier to learn compared with Ruby. This may not always be true though. In fact, one study found that Java programmers were faster at learning Python. So while both languages can do well when used together, it’s important to consider which kind of programming you’re looking for. What about performance? One thing I’ve noticed over time is that performance tends to improve across different languages. The reason being that, unlike most languages, Perl has no built-in garbage collector. As such, any memory allocated by code will eventually get freed up again.","Php is better than perl.Re: how to link Apache and Oracle?  nowayjose_at_telus.  net says... .  PHP is much simpler to learn than Java, and a bit easier than Perl. We run a cluster of Unix/Linux web servers, mostly with Apache/PHP (a couple of Linux/Tomcat for JSP/Applet work) against a single grunt data server secured behind a couple of firewalls.

If you’re looking for something more than just “write code and get it out there”, then PHP might be your best choice. But if you’re interested in writing code, but don’t care about getting things done quickly, then PHP’s syntax may not appeal as much. The same goes with Perl. While it’s possible to learn Python using Python, learning Ruby through Rails isn’t quite so easy. And while there are many other languages which can help you do some of these things, they aren’t all equally easy either. So how does one choose? Well, that’s where we come in. We asked our readers who have used both languages, whether they’d recommend either language over the other. Here was their response: This post has been updated since its original publication. It originally stated that Ruby had fewer developers per capita than Python. In fact, Ruby programmers make up less than half of Ruby’s total developer population."," The PHP community is a very active one, and there are many different ways to get involved in the community. Some people prefer to contribute directly through their own projects, while others choose to work with other projects that have similar goals. This article will discuss some of these options for those who want to contribute. There are two main types of contributions you can make as an open source developer: either by writing code or by providing documentation. Both approaches require a lot of time from your team, but they both give back something valuable. If you’re interested in contributing to this community, I recommend reading up on how to do it yourself. Writing Code You don’t need any programming experience at all to start working on PHP. All that’s required is basic knowledge about Perl, which you’ll learn here. You’ll also find out what kind of modules you should use when building your application, whether it’s using modules, packages, etc. Documentation A good way to help improve documentation is to write it."," The first thing I want to say about this is that the PHP community has been very supportive of me and my work. They have given me a lot of support in terms of getting things done on my own time and they are always willing to help out with any questions or issues I have. This means a lot. But as far as I’m concerned, there isn’t much difference between Python 2 and 3. In fact, if you look at some of the code I’ve written for Python, you’ll see that it’s almost exactly what it was when I wrote it. It’s just more verbose now. And that’s not really an issue because most people don’t care how long something takes them to do. If you’re writing code, chances are, you’ve already got your eyes set on doing something. So why spend all that extra time thinking up ways to make it faster? For example, one way I’d like to do things faster would be by using a database instead of a text file."," and a few other languages that I know of. The problem with this is that it doesn't really matter what language you use as long as the code works in your environment. If you're using PHP for example, then all of those things are going to work just fine. But if you're writing an application written in Perl, Python or Ruby on Rails, then you'll have some problems. And that's where the real fun begins. This article will focus primarily on PHP, but there are plenty of reasons why it's worth learning any language. It's not hard at all. Just do it. You'll be glad you did. What You Need To Know About Programming Languages Before we get started, let's talk about programming languages. There are many different kinds out there, each one has its own strengths and weaknesses. Some people like C++, others prefer Java. Others still like Ruby, Python, etc. These days, most programmers don't even bother trying to learn these languages, they just pick up whatever tool suits their needs. That's fine by me.","You probably want PHP.  It is free.  It runs on Apache, which is also free.  Apache runs on Windows, Linux, Mac, BSD and probably other operating systems also.

If you have Windows, just download apache2triad and that will install Apache, PHP, MySQL, Perl, and many other good programs on your computer with just a few clicks.

The ASP.NET development tools are expensive and limiting.  IIS only runs on Windows XP Pro, so you would have to upgrade to Pro if you just have XP Home.  Windows hosting is more expensive.  Better to stick to LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) -- you can run Apache on your Windows machine while writing scripts, but you will probably host the web site on a Linux server.  Linux server = cheaper and better.

Cold Fusion = also expensive.

PHP = can handle very big projects.  Probably the most common scripting language.

If your goal is to learn a new language and build up an understanding of the fundamentals then yes, but if your aim is to get into programming in general, or even just learning how to program in general then no, because there are many other languages out there. The only thing that matters here is whether you can actually do something with it. And if not, why should anyone care? So let’s take this question one step further. What does it mean when someone says “Java is better”? Is it really true at all? Let’s look at some examples from my own experience. My first experience was working as a programmer for a company which had been acquired by another company. This meant we were now part of a larger organisation called Oracle Corporation. We worked closely together on several projects, including our flagship product, Oracle.","Python is better than java for learning Object Oriented Design.
Python is very useful for a variety of different scenarios: .  building a small application or utility by just writing the code - no ""compile and link"" steps as it is interpreted .  building something iteratively (top down design & development) as your code is always runnable (being interpreted) .  prototyping object based code quicker and easier than compiled languages such as Java.
I wouldn't mind if it evolved some more functionality present in Java, we are getting closer with things like LocalStorage and newer features which makes me really excited.  Python is quite a good language, but the implementations suck.  This is holding back widespread use of Python.  It's too slow, typically 10x to 30x slower than C. That's far worse than Java. ","The python is better than java. 
On the one hand:
1) Python is easier to program in than Java. 
2) Python syntax is much easier to read than Java. 
3) No matter what interpreter (currently available) you use, it is slower than Java and C. 

On the other hand: 
1) I think Java is a better choice than Python for this project. 
2) But Java is also an order of magnitude faster than Python.

On the one hand: 
1) prototyping object based code quicker and easier than compiled languages such as Java . 
2) Python is more of a regular programming language, but simpler and easier to program than Java. 
3) In some cases using a Python API is quicker and easier than always using the corresponding Java API calls, so feel free to use whichever API makes most sense.

On the other hand:
1) It's too slow, typically 10x to 30x slower than C. That's far worse than Java. 
2) It seems a bit slow compared to straight Java, but I'm hoping that will get better as it matures (but it is way faster than Python). 
3) Always these benchmarks reveal that Python is slower then Java and faster than PHP.","I would prefer to use python because it's easier, easier to program and quicker. But you should know that java is faster, easier and better for socalled algorithm refinement.","I came to the conclusion that python is better, because it's easier to develop for, easier to program in and simpler. But i should tell you that java is faster, quicker and better for socalled algorithm refinement.","I am not sure which one to choose. The main reason why Python and Ruby are so popular in the industry today is that they have a lot of libraries available on GitHub (https://github.com/python-dev/python). These libraries can be used by developers from all over the world who want to learn how to use them. This makes it easier than learning programming languages using only books written by developers. But there are some drawbacks with these libraries. For example, you cannot easily share your code between different projects. You also need to install them before starting any project. And if you don’t know what you’re doing, then it’s hard to get started. So this leads me to choose Java. Another drawback about Java: It has no built-in support for web development."," The following is a list of the top 10 best programming languages to learn object-oriented design.

In Java, you have a single thread per process, which means each process has its own memory and can be started or stopped independently. This makes it easy for multiple processes to share memory, but also allows them to run concurrently without interfering with one another. You can think of this as being like having your cake and eating it, too. If you’re running several threads at once, then you’ll need more than just one processor core – you’ll probably want two. On the other hand, if you’re using Python, it’s possible to use multiple cores on an application by simply adding additional threads. For example, let’s say we wanted to create a web server that would serve up content from our website over HTTP. We could do so by creating many threads, starting all of them when they were created, and stopping only those that needed to stop running."," and implementation is a good place to start.

What does it mean to be an OOP designer? Can you give me some examples and maybe even show how they are done? The article seems to suggest that design patterns can be learned in any language. However, what if we want to learn them from other languages? For example, let’s say I’m interested in designing software with Ruby on Rails. How do I go about doing that? Do I need to start by studying Java first? Or should I study Python first before moving onto Ruby? If you’re looking at Ruby, I’d recommend starting with Learn Ruby. It’s not really meant as a tutorial but rather more like a reference book. It covers all aspects of programming using Ruby including syntax, data structures, etc. You could also try Learning Python. Both books cover many topics related to programming. In fact, both books were written specifically for programmers who wanted to get started with Python, so they’re great resources too. Great article!"," I think it depends on the type of learning you are doing. If your goal is to learn how objects work and what they can do, then yes, Java is a good language because it has many features that make object-oriented programming easy in Java. But if you want to learn about design patterns or functional programming, then there are other languages out there. For example, Clojure is an interesting choice as well. It uses functions instead of objects, but still allows us to write code like this: This example shows how we could have written this program without using any classes at all. The only difference between our original function and the one shown here is that now we use clojure.core’s map function. We also added some extra methods so that we don’t need to pass around references anymore. In fact, all these changes were done by hand with no help from the compiler. You might be wondering why I’m writing such long blog posts when my readers will probably get bored reading them. Well, it’s not just me.","Smalltalk is better than java for learning Object Oriented Design.

On the one hand:
1) Lack of type information is a disadvantage, but the advantages of Smalltalk made it a lot easier to make a refactoring browser for Smalltalk than it would have have been for C++ or Java. 
2) The UGens are written in C++(though the sclang is a kind of smalltalk dialect), meaning that(theoretically) it would be easier to convert them into c(or c++)-based msp externals than java-based object. 
3) And Smalltalk Browsers are far easier to learn & use than any of the major Java IDEs. 

On the other hand:

It has been my experience that learning Object-Oriented Design with any other programming language, such as Java, C++, C# and even C#, can lead you down an unproductive path. The reason why this happens is because of two main reasons: 1. Ruby's syntax makes it very easy to write code which does not follow the rules of good OO design. This means that if your code doesn't work out how it's supposed to, then you're going to have some serious problems when trying to debug it.2. Because Ruby uses classes instead of objects, there are no restrictions on what objects can do - everything is possible within the class. In fact, class inheritance allows us to create new types without having to worry about inheritance. For example, let's say we want to add another method called add_method."," In this post I will explain the differences between Smalltalk, Java, and Objective-C in terms of learning object-oriented design. The main difference is that Smalltalk has a more structured approach to learning, whereas Java does not. This article assumes you have some knowledge about programming languages before reading it. If not, then read on at your own risk. What are Object Oriented Design? An OO program consists of an abstract class called “object” which represents all objects (classes, methods, etc.) within its scope. Objects can be created or destroyed by other objects. A method may return any type of object, including null objects, but it must not create new instances of itself. Methods cannot access variables outside their scope unless they explicitly declare them as private. When creating an instance of a class, methods should always use private variables. Classes define how classes interact with each other. They also provide interfaces so that code written inside one class can call another class."," The first thing that I want to do is show you a comparison between the two languages. This will be done using an example from my book “Developing with Java” which shows how both languages are used in real world applications. In this example, we have created a simple web application and then added some functionality for our users. We can see here that there are many similarities between these languages, but also differences. For instance, while Java has static types, Smalltalk does not. Also, although they share most of their features, they differ on one important aspect: performance. While Java uses garbage collection, Smalltalk’s implementation doesn’t use it. However, it should not matter because even though the performance difference may seem small, it’s still significant. Let’s start by looking at what kind of code each language uses. As usual, I’ll assume that I’m going to write small applications so let’s look at something simple."," and programming in Java. The book is a collection of essays by experts on the subject who have contributed to various aspects of object-oriented design. It contains many interesting articles that are not available anywhere else online. I recommend it as an introduction to the subject. This article was written with the intention of presenting some new ideas about OO design, but also to provide a good overview of what has been done so far. In particular, this article will introduce you to several different approaches to designing objects using OOP. You can read more about each approach here. Object-Oriented Design (OO) is one of those topics which seems very abstract at first glance, but when we start talking about it, we realize how important it is. We all know that software development involves writing code, right? Well, if so, then most people would agree that creating code should be easy. But it’s not. Most developers don’t even think about it. They just write code. And that’s exactly why they end up making mistakes. If you’re going to make mistakes, you’ll need to learn something new.","It depends o what you want to do with it. java is widely used ut a bit bulky and has too much of legacy.

1) Huge systems have been built in Smalltalk (a whole phone company was built on it) and Rails and they scale BETTER than rigid runtimes like Java because they are more flexible.

3) c, I would argue, is a fine language to learn the 'under the hood' aspects of programming, and c++ or java for moving to the OOP world; not because they are better than Smalltalk, but because they are in wider use.

On the other hand: 
1) I'd say that it didn't become mainstream simply because the marketting of Sun Java was better than that of any Smalltalk vendor.

It has many advantages over other languages like Java which are more verbose than Smalltalk. The main advantage that Smalltalk offers to me as an experienced programmer is its simplicity in writing code. In my experience most programmers who use Smalltalk do so because they want something simple but powerful. They don't care about how complex their code is. This makes them easy to teach. If you can teach someone what Smalltalk is, then why would anyone ever need another language? Ruby on Rails was created by two guys from MIT named Yehuda Katz and Rasmus Lerdorf. Both were very passionate about developing web applications with Ruby. One day while working at Google they came up with the idea to create a framework called Rubyon. After some initial development work they released version 1.0 in 2004. Version 2.0 followed shortly after. At this point there wasn't much demand for it. However, after seeing how popular Python was, they decided to release version 2.1."," I think that the answer to this question depends on what you are looking for.

However, if you want to learn about programming in general, or just programming, then Ruby would probably do better. The reason why Ruby seems like an easier language to pick up is because of its syntax. It has fewer keywords which makes it much simpler to learn. In contrast, Java’s syntax can get quite complex when dealing with objects and methods.

If your goal is a more robust and performant web application then Ruby would be better. But if you want something that will run faster than java in production environments then Go might be better. The problem with Go is its lack of support for concurrency. This means it cannot handle concurrent access well at all. It also has no way to deal gracefully with memory fragmentation. You can only do one thing at a time which makes concurrency very difficult. To make things worse there is not even an option to use threads so all code must be written as single threaded code. So my advice is go with Java. There are many good reasons why but here we focus on performance. In terms of performance Go wins hands down. Even though Go does have some overhead compared to Java, it’s still much less than other languages. For example when running a benchmark against java, the difference between the two languages was about 10x smaller."," The following is a list of the most popular programming languages and their respective learning environments.

JavaScript JavaScript’s syntax has been described by many people over the years. It was originally designed with functional programming, but it can also be used without it. In fact, it’s so easy to learn that even beginners are able to use this language easily. However, there are still several things which make it difficult for newcomers to learn. One thing that’s not mentioned often enough is its lack of documentation. For example, when someone wants to know why something works or doesn’t work, he needs to look at the source code instead of reading through an article. Another problem is that developers don’t always understand what they’re doing."," on Rails The first thing to understand is that there are two different types of programming languages. There are the “pure” languages, which have no side effects and can be used in any context, like a computer program or an operating system. These languages are called imperative programming. They focus only on pure functions. In contrast, functional programming, where you write code for one purpose only, such as data processing, will often involve side-effects. This means that your function may return something other than what it was intended to. For example, if I want to print out some text from my computer, I’ll need to call printf() with arguments that include things like: printf = ""hello"" If this were written in Java, I’d get back this: printf = ""Hello "" + ""Hello.txt"" But since I’m writing this in Ruby, it’s not going to work because I don’t know how to read the string ""hello world""."," and implementation This course is designed to help you learn the fundamentals of object-oriented programming in Java.

29,apple,intel,,"the comparison between acer,intel,dell,apple?"," I think that you are missing a key point here. The reason why Apple is so successful in this market is because they have been able to create products with very high profit margins and low margin/cost of production. They do not need to sell their product at full price or even close to it. If they did that, then there would be no incentive for them to innovate as much as possible. This means that if they were selling something like an iMac for $1500 instead of $1000 (which seems reasonable given what it can do), then innovation could only happen by making incremental improvements on existing products. As long as these things remain affordable, people will buy them. So yes, I agree with your point, but I disagree about how Apple has managed this. Their business model depends heavily on being able to make money from devices which don’t require any new technology. That is, they get rich off old technology while keeping prices low. In other words, they keep costs down through economies of scale. And that’s exactly what’s happening right now."," The answer to that question depends on what you mean by “better.” If you’re talking about the hardware and software of a computer, then yes, it’s better. But if you’re comparing it with other computer makers, like Dell or HP, then no, Apple’s not really any better, at least in terms of overall performance. In fact, according to our own tests, its performance lags behind even some low-end netbooks. And that’s just for basic tasks, such as web browsing, word processing, spreadsheets, etc. On top of that, there’s no way around it: Apple’s Mac OS X isn’t optimized for Intel chips, so you’ll have problems running many programs designed specifically for them. So how does this compare against Windows PCs? Well, we ran several tests using both Macs and PCs from Dell, HP and Lenovo. All three are pretty much identical except one thing: they all run Windows. We also tested them side by side, but only because they’re all made by the same company, Apple. This means we’re looking at apples vs. oranges.","Intel is better than apple.

1) I installed an 80gb Intel X25-M and am really happy with the results - apps open MUCH faster and OSX boots much quicker than with the original 200gb/5,400rpm offering from Apple/Hitachi. 
2) A second reason: it turns out that Intel chips are faster and better than PowerPC chips after all, despite decades of vehement Apple fanboy arguments to the contrary. 
3) The G4 processor used in the Apple notebooks is inferior to any recent Intel notebook processor.","I would prefer to use apple because it's faster, cleaner and easier. But i should tell you that intel is quicker, faster and simpler.","It's simple! Apple is better, because it's sooner and cleaner. But you should know that intel is quicker, faster and cheaper."," The answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a laptop that can run Windows and Linux at the same time, then Intel has an edge over Apple. However, if you just need something for basic computing tasks, such as web browsing, word processing, spreadsheets, and so on, then it really doesn’t matter which processor your computer has. You will be happy with either one. Which one should I buy? There are two main choices when choosing between these processors. One option would be to go with the i5-6600K processor, but there are many other options out there. For example, AMD offers their own processors in the X370 chipset series, while Nvidia also makes its own chips under the GeForce brand. In addition, some of the newer chipsets from AMD, like the Ryzen 7 2700, offer integrated graphics solutions. These solutions may not have all the bells and whistles of Intel's processors, but they do provide better performance than most of the mainstream options."," The latest in a series of articles on the battle between Microsoft and Apple, this time focusing on Intel’s new Core i7 processor line. As you can see from the title above, it is not just about CPU speed, but also power consumption as well. This article will be covering both aspects of the chip line with some additional information to help understand how they are used together for different tasks. In addition, we will cover other areas that may interest you. We hope these two posts provide enough detail so that you have an idea what kind of performance gains or improvements you might expect when using one versus another processor.

This means they have a lot of the same apps as their predecessors, but there are some notable differences. For example, the iPad’s version has an app called “Find My iPhone” which lets you find your missing phone. You can also use it for finding nearby friends or family members. On iOS, this feature was available on all devices except for the original iPad. It wasn’t until later versions when it became possible to turn off location services in Settings. Another difference between these two operating systems is how much data each device uses. In general, Android phones tend to be more power-hungry than Apple’s, so if you’re using them heavily you’ll probably notice a difference. However, it’s important not to get too hung up over it. If you want to know what kind of battery life you’re getting out of your phone, just look at the device’s battery. It’s usually listed somewhere near its advertised capacity."," and the other is a company that has been around for decades but still doesn't have an app store. The second point of contention was whether Google should be allowed to sell ads on its search engine. This would allow it to make money from people who use Google's services without having to pay them directly. It also means Google could charge more than any other internet service provider in order to get users to buy their services. In response, Google said it had no plans to do this. ""We don't believe we need to,"" wrote CEO Larry Page. ""Google already pays billions of dollars every year into the US Treasury. We think it's time to stop worrying about how much we're paying and instead focus our efforts where they will add value: improving people's lives."" But this argument didn't convince many people. Many argued that Google shouldn't even bother with advertising at all. They pointed out that, if you want your website to rank well, then you can't just rely on Google. You must work hard to improve it. And that's exactly what Google does. It's not perfect, though.","Acer and Dell are window based PCs Apple has different OS and easy to use and maintain but pricy.

However, if you need something more powerful when doing work related tasks, such as video editing or gaming, then you’d probably prefer some other laptop. For example, if you do lots of gaming but don’t mind spending extra money on a high-end graphics card, then I’d recommend getting one from Alienware.

Intel Is A Better Buy Than HP, Dell . Over the past month, some of the largest PC and technology manufacturers, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ), Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ ), and Dell (NASDAQ: DELL ), have reported both quarterly and yearly reports.  In the wake of the explosion of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) into the computer sector, these companies that rely extensively on Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) have fallen on harder times.  All three of these companies have put forth new strategies to maintain market share and build future growth and profitability. 
The Dell XPS 13 uses older tech, but still costs nearly the same as this 13-inch Air.  Arguably, the Air offers a lot of advantages too.  The screen is 16:10, which, for most computer use is far better than that stupid 16:9 ratio, foisted upon us by HD television.  So, for £50 more than the entry-level Dell XPS 13, you get faster RAM, a quicker processor built on more modern technology and better graphics (Intel 4000 on the Mac, as opposed to 3000 on the Dell).","The intel is better than dell. 
On the one hand:
1) The new MacBook Air with the Intel Haswell chipset and Intel HD 5000 should be able to run those games you mentioned as well as or better than your older Dell. 
2) Asked whether Apple can better create innovative products than cost-conscious PC makers such as Dell, Otellini responded carefully: ""Having a customer that can match our intensity [for innovation] is really exciting for us. 
3) Using your PC is now easier than ever with Dell Stage and the optional multi-touch display available on XPS laptops. 

On the other hand: 
1) gateway sucks (11:31pm EST Sat Feb 21 2004) gateways uses the cheapest ass parts in the most expensive computers, they are even worse than DELL! 
2) In a submission to the Commission, Dell also stated that as regards Opteron, ""in Dell's perception this CPU generally performed approximately [...] better than the comparable Intel Xeon CPU at the time.

If you want a laptop with the best battery life and performance, then Intel has got it covered. But if you need something more powerful than that, then go for Dell’s Inspiron. It comes in two flavours, one of which features an i7 processor while the other uses an AMD processor. Both laptops have plenty of power but they also come at different price points. For example, the Inspiron’s base model starts from $799 whereas the XPS 15 9370 Gaming Laptop will set you back $1,799. You can check out our review of both models here. Which brand should I buy?

In a recent survey by market research firm IDC, Apple and Google were tied at first place with Windows 8 in terms of overall PC sales. However, both companies are looking to expand their presence into tablets as well. And while Microsoft has been losing ground on that front, it still holds an edge over its rivals when it comes to mobile devices. According to IDC analyst Brian Blau, Apple’s iOS devices have outsold Android handsets since they launched last year, but Android-based tablets continue to dominate sales across all major categories. “Tablets represent more than half of total tablet shipments this year,” he said. “The iPad continues to be the most popular tablet, accounting for nearly 50% of U.S. tablet shipments.” But it’s not just about tablets. Gartner predicts that PCs will overtake smartphones worldwide within five years. That means there could soon be two dominant operating systems running side-by-side — one for PCs, another for smartphones."," The battle for the future of computing is heating up. In a recent interview with CNBC, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that he believes in Intel’s ability to compete against AMD. He also mentioned that his company has been working on an “innovative” chip called Cannonlake. However, it seems like Apple’s plans are not as innovative as they seem. According to Bloomberg, Apple will be using its own chips instead of those from Intel. Bloomberg reports that Apple could use AMD processors if it wanted to. This would mean that Apple wouldn’t have to buy any new chips, but rather just make them compatible with existing ones. It appears that Apple may actually go ahead and purchase some of these chips. If so, this means that Apple won’t need to rely solely on Intel anymore. With all of the rumors about Apple buying up ARM processors, we might see more products based off of ARM. For example, Apple could release their own ARM-based processor or even build one themselves."," and the other two are from a third party vendor.

31,foam,wood,insulator,"which insulator is better, wood or styrofoam?"," The answer to this question depends on the type of insulation you are using. If your roof has a metal roof, then it will be better than wood, but if not, it may not be. In general, fiberglass and vinyl insulation, while they have lower thermal conductivity than metal, do offer some protection against heat loss. However, these materials can also trap moisture in their structure, making them less effective at cooling down when temperatures drop below freezing. This means that even though they might provide more insulating properties, they won’t help much with cold weather temperatures. Wood Insulation vs. Styrofoam One thing I learned about building my house was how important it is to choose between two types of insulation. When choosing an insulated material, it’s important to consider what kind of structure you’re building. For example, wooden structures tend to get hotter during hot summer days, so you’ll want something that’s cooler for winter use. But because most people build houses without any sort of air conditioning, there’s no reason why you’d need to use plywood as an insulator."," The answer is that it depends on the type of foam. If you are using a hard foam, then yes, they will work better. However, if you are using a softer foam, like memory foams, then there may be some issues with insulation. I have used both types and can say that when compared to wood, insulation works much better, but not as well as foams. There are also other factors such as how thick your walls are, what kind of insulation you have, etc. which affect performance. How do we know this? We tested them in our own home by putting them up against each other. They did not perform any differently at all. In fact, one was actually warmer because of its higher density. This means that even though their density might seem low, these materials still provide excellent heat retention properties. Is this true? It is. When comparing two materials, the difference between the two should always be greater than the amount of time spent insulating them.","Foam is better than wood for insulator.
The plan is to shave the foam down so that it's flush with the side of the staircase beneath it. Then I'll skim-coat over the foam with joint compound.  Once everything is painted, it should look seamless.  And spraying foam is much faster and easier than cutting little strips of wood to fill in each gap.
Go for it, reach for your dreams, but it's all been proven done and packed away.  Sorry I am a bit late on the reply, but it is possible to build wooden sailboards even at weights comparable to cobra boards.  There are a number of different construction methods.  The time taken to build out of wood is definitely much greater than building out of foam.","Foam is better than wood. 
On the one hand:
1) Also, foam is much easier to cut to fit the complex contour of the rock than are wood forms. 
2) A foam cushion, for example, can burn like gasoline because the chemical components release heat faster than natural materials like wood and cotton. 
3) I have more than a hunch that any of the 3 foam cores I have built would be considerably better in wood. 

On the other hand:
1) A wood core adds weight to the ski but offers better durability and responsiveness than foam. 
2) Wood and the carpet flooring had greater mass and were a larger source of energy than the foam, although the wood and carpet required longer times to ignite. 
3) Even the first time through, ICFs were much faster, easier to handle, and no more expensive than blocks w/ foam installed on the outside. 
","Foam is better than wood. 
On the one hand: 
1) And spraying foam is much faster and easier than cutting little strips of wood to fill in each gap. 
2) Foam-cored construction might be a good option as well, and may be simpler and a bit easier than cold-molded wood construction. 
3) Cases made of foam or fiberglass are lighter to carry than wooden cases and also tend to resist temperature changes better than either wood or plastic cases.

On the other hand:
1) Even the first time through, ICFs were much faster, easier to handle, and no more expensive than blocks w/ foam installed on the outside. 
2) The Gel Dough® formula creates a cooler, softer memory foam that maintains form for better support than traditional memory foams. 
3) I'd think that wood would be a better insulator than plexiglass, but if you put that foam styrofoam insulation over top of it in the winter, it probably wouldn't matter all that much.","After much thought, I realized that  foam is better, because it's faster, easier and simpler. Wood is easier to handle, faster and easier.","I would prefer to use foam because it's stronger, lighter and easier. Wood is softer and easier to handle."," The answer to this question depends on the type of foam you are using. If it has a strong odor and feels like wood, then it’s probably wood. But if it smells like foam, but doesn’t feel as solid when squeezed, then it’s likely foam. How do I know which one is which? Well, there are two main ways that people can tell what kind of wood they have. One way is by looking at how much pressure each side exerts on it. This will give them an idea about whether they’re made from different types of woods. Another method is by using their own hands to squeeze them. You don’t have to use your hands, just make sure you’re squeezing both sides equally. When you get close enough to see through them, you’ll be able to determine which material is which. So now we need some tools for making our own. We want something that’s easy to use, durable, and won’t break easily. There are many things out there, including wooden toothpicks and plastic tweezers."," The foam is the most common type of material used in a mattress, and it has been around for quite some time. It comes from natural sources such as trees or plants, but also synthetic materials like polyurethane. These types are made by adding water to an existing liquid that contains chemicals called polyesters. Polyesters can be found in many different kinds of products including food packaging, clothing, car seats, mattresses, etc. They have become very popular because they offer superior comfort compared to other materials. However, there are two main problems with these foams. First, they’re not breathable. This means you can’t use them on hot summer days without sweating profusely. Second, their chemical composition makes them flammable, which could cause fires. If you’re looking for something more durable, try out memory foam. Memory foams come in three types: gel, foam, and firm. You should choose one based on your preference. A gel mattress will provide support while still being soft enough so that you’ll sink into it. A firm mattress provides just enough firmness to make sleeping comfortable."," The foam is a very dense material and will be much more durable than the wood used in most of these kits. It also has a higher density which means it can support heavier loads without breaking. This makes for a better overall structure that won’t break as easily when you need to move it. If you’re looking at building this kit from scratch then I would recommend using some sort of glue or epoxy on all joints so they don’t come apart during transport. You could use super glue, but it’s not recommended because it may weaken the structure. Step 2: Cutting Out Parts Once you’ve cut out your pieces you’ll want to start gluing them together. You’ll have to make sure they’re lined up correctly before putting any screws into them. Make sure everything lines up. To do this, first measure where each piece should go onto the frame. Then mark off one side with a pencil if there are no holes there. Now drill two small pilot holes. These should line up perfectly with the other side."," The most common type of foam is made from polyurethane. This material has a high density and low weight. It can be used for many purposes such as making furniture, car seats, mattresses, etc. However, it does not have the same strength as wood so you will need to use more than one type. If your project requires heavy duty foam, then you’ll want to go with something like polystyrene foam. Polystyrene foam is very strong but also quite heavy. You may find that this kind of foam would make an excellent base for some sort of structure. For example, if you’re building a house out of wood, you could build up walls using these types of foams. They are extremely durable and won’t break easily. Another option is to choose a different material. There are several kinds of plastic available in various grades. Some plastics are stronger than others, which means they don’t crack when being squeezed. Others are softer and therefore easier on the environment. These materials aren’t usually found at home improvement stores, however, because they’re often too expensive compared to other options.","Insulation slows the rate of heat flow from a warm area to a cooler one, solid objects transfer heat much more easy than objects that are less dense, Polyethylene Foam transfers heat at a faster rate than wood, Polyurethane Foam transfers heat slower than wood, I guess your answer is depends on what kind of styrofoam your using :)",1,"The foam is better than wood. 
On the one hand:
1) This guy said they will gravitate to foam because it's a lot easier to get into than wood. 
2) Wherever you can access it, using 1-2"" of closed-cell spray polyurethane foam to air-seal and insulate the foundation sill and band joist is probably a better first step, since that will better protect the structural wood from wintertime interior moisture than Tripolymer. 
3) The soft foam Baby Building Blocks are great for babies because they are safer than wood blocks, some squeak or crinkle, and many have fabric doors you open to see drawings of people. 
4) I chose foam-cored skis because they are generally lighter and have a softer flex than wood-cored skis making them much better suited for backcountry touring. 
5) A foam cushion, for example, can burn like gasoline because the chemical components release heat faster than natural materials like wood and cotton.

On the other hand:
1) Materials CAN play a big role, but I've seen wood and fiberglass bows shooting faster than carbon and foam limbed bows in terms of sheer speed because they had more reflex and a more efficient limb design. 
2) With NuWa's combined use of wood and aluminum substructure, you get a superior product because of NuWa's unique Blue Dow foam vacu-bond process, which makes the sidewalls virtually resistant to water penetration. 
3) The feel of a wood board in the water is better than any traditional foam board because the wood resonates with the vibrations of the waves. 
4) It is better then the hard foam panels - pink or blue - because it is extremely flexible and will not crack or break up when you walk on it. 
5) This makes sense since dense materials such as metals and solid wood transmit sound better than porous materials, like foam and air.",1," The answer to this question depends on the type of insulation you are using and how much it will cost you. If your house has a lot of insulation, then I would recommend using wood. It can be very expensive but if you have an old house, like mine, that was built in the early 1900’s with no insulation, then it’s worth it. You won’t need any more than one layer of plywood for most applications.",,"  I think the answer to that question depends on what you are trying to insulate and how much insulation you want to provide. If your goal is just to keep out some of the wind chill, then a wooden box will do fine. But if you have an insulated roof or other form of protection over your house, it may be worth investing in something more substantial. For example, consider using plywood as insulation instead of foam. It can also help with insulating against moisture from rain water when used under tarps."
32,concrete,wood,ties,What are the pros and cons of using wooden ties vs. concrete ties?," Concrete ties can be used for a variety of reasons, but they tend to have more strength than wood ties. They also don’t rot as easily when exposed to moisture, which is important in areas where there isn’t much water or humidity. The downside with cement ties, however, is that they’re not very durable. If you need them to last longer than two years, you’ll want to use steel tie rods. How do I know if my wooden ties will hold up under water? Wooden ties should withstand at least one year without deteriorating. However, some types may deteriorate faster than others. For example, galvanized metal wire has been shown to degrade quicker than other materials. To determine whether your wood ties will stand up to water, simply test it by filling each end of the tie with water. You might find that it’s easier to fill all four ends of the tie before placing it into the ground. Can I put plastic bags over my wooden ties? Plastic bags aren’t recommended because they won’t protect against moisture from rain or snow."," I have a friend who has been using wooden ties to hold down his fence posts and he says they are holding up well. He also uses them in place of cement ties. Is that true? If so, what do you think about the benefits of wood? Do you use it as an alternative or does your neighbor not like it? The main reason why people don’t want to put plastic on their fences is because it’s hard to get off when they’re wet. You can just wipe them with a damp cloth but if you’re going to be doing this over several years then you’ll need something stronger. Plastic doesn’t stand up well to rain so we usually stick to metal stakes. We haven’t tried any other type yet. What kind of soil should my garden have? Soil needs to be rich enough to support lots of plants without getting too soggy from watering all day. It helps to keep weeds out by keeping things moist at night. A good mix will help too.

Specially engineered cross-laminated timber is replacing concrete and steel in buildings up to 10 storeys high in places like London, Melbourne and Vienna, with plans for much higher.  Wood is deemed lighter, cheaper, greener and easier to build with than steel or concrete. The Europeans, notably the Austrians, have been checking this out for 30 years, finding it, unlike standard wood-frame building, no more of a fire hazard than anything else.
By comparison, its module of elasticity, and durability is small, and its volumetric capacity to changes in humidity renders wood an inferior material to that of reinforced concrete.  Given enough time, whenever wood is exposed to the elements, it rots.  The durability of concrete is superior to that of wood. Even where wood structures stand today, practically as the only ones in existence, their maintenance in good structural condition is very costly. ","Wood is better than concrete.

But i should tell you that concrete is easier to clean, stronger and higher."," The answer to this question depends on the type of wood you are using. If it has a high moisture content, then concrete will be better for your project. However, if it does not have enough moisture, then wooden construction may work better. It can also depend on how much time and effort you want to put into it. For example, if you only need one day per week, then wooden construction would probably be more suitable. How do I know what kind of wood I’m going to use? You should always check with local building materials suppliers before buying any materials. They usually sell their own brand of wood. Check out our guide below to find out which types of woods are best suited for you. Types of Wood There are many different kinds of wood, but they all share some common characteristics. These characteristics include: Hardness – This determines whether a material is strong enough to withstand pressure from being poured onto it, as well as its ability to resist water penetration."," The most common type of wood is the hard wood. This includes pine, birch, and oak. These are all very strong woods, but they also have a lot of moisture in them. They can be used for many different things, such as building houses, boats, furniture, etc. However, if you want to build something that will last longer than just one season, then it needs to be made from wood, not concrete. If your house has been built with concrete, this may cause problems down the road. You need to make sure there aren’t any cracks or other damage before putting up new siding. Another thing to consider when choosing which kind of siding to use on your home is how much water you’ll need. In general, concrete tends to hold more water, so it’s better to go with that. But some people prefer using wooden siding, because they’re lighter and easier to work with. It depends what you’re looking for. Some people like to put their houses out back where there’s lots of sun, while others prefer them closer in."," The most common type of wood is concrete. It has a high density and can be used for many purposes. However, it does not have the strength or durability to support large structures. In fact, concrete structures are often made from wood. This makes them vulnerable to earthquakes and hurricanes. To make your home more resilient, you should consider using wooden construction materials. These materials will last longer than concrete, but they also cost less. You may want to choose natural woods such as cedar or balsa. If you’re looking at building an outdoor home, there are several types of timber that could work well in this application. One option would be redwood planks. They come in various sizes and thicknesses depending on how much space they’re going to have. Another choice might be oak plywood, which comes in different colors and sizes. Both these options offer great insulation qualities. Choosing Your Roof Material When choosing your roof material, it’s important to look into what kind of structure you’ll need it for."," The most common type of concrete is concrete. It consists of a mixture of sand, water, and other materials. This mix can be used to create many different types of concrete, but the main difference between them are their properties. Concretes have two major properties: strength (ability to resist deformations caused by loading) and durability (the amount of time it takes for water to penetrate through concrete). Strength: Concrete has high tensile strength, which means that if you put enough force on it, it will not break. However, this does come at a cost. If your project requires more than one layer of concrete, then you’ll need to use thicker layers in order to prevent cracking. For example, if you’re building an arch over a road, you’d want to make sure there was no cracking because cracks weaken the structure. You could also consider using thinner concrete layers, such as 2×4 or 4×4, to reduce the overall weight of the arch. Durability: Concrete has low thermal expansion, meaning that, when exposed to heat, its molecules expand less quickly than they would otherwise.","Wood ties are the standard choice... Hardwoods, treated with creosote, they have an extended service lives. They can be layed and used anywhere, individually -- since the spikes are simply pounded in, the wood ties can be used in a switch or anywhere without modification. They are however more prone to rot, damage, and even fire when oil soaked from locomotives.

Concrete ties are becoming more numerous. They are more rigid than wood, and are not prone to rot, and are pre-treated for expansion/contraction like the welded rail they hold. They are associated with higher speed trackage due to not needing the upkeep of wood. One con of concrete would be the hardware associated with hold the rail -- special ties are required for specific locations and uses, unlike wood. Also, 2 (and I've seen 1) man could move a wood tie in a repair, while concrete is heavier and usually layed by machine (crane).",1,"The wood is better than concrete. 
On the one hand:
1) Alternatively, wood and steel are better than unreinforced concrete, stucco or masonry because such materials have greater flexibility. 
2) Wood is typically used because it is readily available and easier to use than steel or concrete. 
3) The Twinsburg plant's floor was made of pecan blocks because they could withstand the ceaseless vibrations better than concrete. 
4) As a comparison, we could do the same wall out of wood framing, but since wood is so much lighter than concrete, the foundation would support much less weight.

On the other hand: 
1) In this regard, they're even worse than solid concrete because the steel structure expands with humidity and causes cracks from the inside. 
2) Those roads and bridges are built of concrete because concrete can better endure the abuse than can steel or wood. 
3) It was clear to the eye that the masonry concrete block was far superior to the wood because it had survived the fire. 
4) They decided to build a concrete park because it's easier to build and maintain, and makes for a smoother ride than a wood park. 
5) I like the concrete better because of its strength and it lasts much longer (more reliable) than the wood alternative.",1,"  Concrete ties can be used to hold down a tree or other structure in place during high winds. But they have their own set of problems. They don’t last very long under heavy winds and if you leave them on too long, they’ll start to rot. The wood tie is much better at withstanding wind but it doesn’t work well for smaller trees. It also has its drawbacks. If you’re going to use them, make sure they’re tied securely enough so that your trees won’t fall over.",," The answer to this question depends on the type of tie you are making. If your ties are made from wood, then it makes sense that a concrete mix would be better. Concrete has more strength and can withstand higher temperatures. However, if your ties are made with concrete, they will not last as long because of their lower strength. This means that concrete mixes should have some kind of insulation in them. For example, fiberglass or aluminum foil might work well. You also need to consider how much water resistance there is."
33,mit,stanford,,Stanford vs. MIT vs. CIT?," The answer is that the two teams are not exactly in a league of their own. While both have been around for quite some time, they don’t really share much with each other. In fact, if you look at the top 10 universities by number of alumni and students per year, it’s clear that there isn’t one school from either region who has more than half its student body coming from outside California. And while California does boast an impressive pool of talent — it ranks fifth overall among states when it comes to college graduates — most of those people come from other parts of the country. But what about the rest of America? What do we know about how many Americans go on to earn PhDs? We can tell you that, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, only 1 percent of all U.S. adults hold bachelor’s degrees or higher. That’s less than half the national average of 4 percent. So why aren’t these numbers higher? Well, because our schools tend to be smaller and, as a result, fewer people graduate from them."," The answer to that question depends on what you mean by “better.” Stanford has a lot of good players and coaches who have been around for decades. But the Cardinal are not as talented or experienced as USC. They lost their starting quarterback last year, but they still won nine games in 2013. And while USC was able to win its first two games, it had trouble with UCLA before losing at home to Washington State. If you’re looking for an example of how much better Stanford can be this season, look no further than the Trojans’ 31-10 victory over Oregon State on Saturday. It wasn’t just that the Trojans were playing without injured star running back Christian McCaffrey, who missed most of his senior season because of injury. It’s also that they didn’t allow any points after halftime. That kind of performance against one of college football’s best teams would normally get them into the top five. Instead, they’re No. 5 behind Alabama, which beat Mississippi State, Oklahoma and Texas A&M earlier Saturday night. Alabama will play Florida next week.","Stanford is better than MIT.

Stanford has been a national power in football for decades, winning three consecutive Rose Bowls and playing in four BCS bowl games. But it also had its share of embarrassing losses during those years, including an upset loss at home against Oregon State in 2009. In contrast, Michigan was not as dominant under Schembechler, but he did win five Big Ten titles while guiding the Wolverines to their first appearance in the title game since 1962. He won his only conference championship with Michigan, which played in seven straight bowls from 1960 through 1967. At Stanford, meanwhile, Walsh led the team to six Pac-10 championships over 13 seasons, going 67-7 overall and 32-3 in conference. His teams were consistently among college football's best teams, even if they never reached the top tier. Walsh, who died Monday after battling cancer, will be remembered more for his success than for any individual accomplishment."," The first game of the season was a close one, but it ended with an upset win for Stanford. It started off on offense and finished in a shootout. This is what happens when you have two teams that are ranked top 5 nationally playing each other. Both teams were very physical and played some great hockey. I think this will be one to watch as both teams look to get back into their winning ways. Game 2 – Washington State VS Oregon In my opinion there wasn’t much between these two. They had similar skill sets and they didn’t play any different than last year. However, Washington’s defense looked better against Oregon. That being said, Oregon’s goalie did not allow many goals either. He made several big saves throughout the game. Game 3 – Michigan State VS Minnesota Duluth Minnesota Duluth came out strong early on. After that, however, things got a little bit more difficult. Minnesota’s goaltender stopped all 30 shots he faced. Michigan’s power play, which has been pretty good so far, couldn’t find its way through the middle of the net."," The first game of the season was a rematch from last year between two teams that were ranked in the top five at one point this season. In fact, both USC and UCLA had been No. 1 for most of the season, but they fell to the Trojans by three points on Saturday. This time, it wasn’t just about who won or lost, though. It was also about how well each team played. Both defenses played well, with USC’s defense holding Stanford to only six points, while Stanford’s offense struggled against an aggressive defense. But what really stood out is how much better the Bruins looked than their opponents. They didn’t have any turnovers until late in the game, which allowed them to get back into games where they could make plays. And when they did, they made them. After getting off to a slow start, UCLA scored 17 straight points. That included four touchdowns — including a touchdown pass from quarterback Josh Rosen to wide receiver Cody Kessler — as well as a two-point conversion run by running back Bryce Love."," University in California. The study was conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and published online on Monday in JAMA Psychiatry. It is one of several studies that have found a link between marijuana use and psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Marijuana users who had used it for at least 12 months were more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia, compared with those who never used it, according to the study. Those using cannabis daily also showed higher rates of depression and anxiety, which can lead to suicidal thoughts. “Cannabis has been shown to increase risk factors for psychosis including psychosis, depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, alcohol use, eating disorders,” said senior author Dr. David Nutt, director of NIMH’s Center for Drug Development. “We don’t know why this association exists, but we think it’s probably because people are exposed to these chemicals through their environment rather than directly from smoking marijuana.” In addition, researchers said, there may not always be clear evidence linking exposure to certain pesticides to mental health problems.","MIT without a doubt.  Yes, I'm biased because I'm an alum, but I have friends at Stanford and Cal Tech who wish they were at MIT.

34,laptop,mobile,,"which is better pc , laptop or mobile ?","Comment: I think it's because of the way we use computers. We're used to having a mouse and keyboard on our desk so that when you want to do something else with your computer ( like work ) you just move the mouse over there instead of moving all around trying to type things in. This makes us feel more comfortable using them than if they were sitting right next to each other. So people tend to be much faster at typing on their laptops then phones. Also, most keyboards aren't designed for touch typists. They have dedicated keys where you can hit letters rather than hitting whole rows of buttons. That means you need to press down harder on those keys to get what you want done. On top of this, many touchpads require two fingers to operate properly - meaning you can't really rest one hand on both sides of the pad while doing anything. You also won't find any laptop/desktop combos without an optical drive either."," The answer to this question depends on what you want your laptop to do. If you’re a power user, then the Surface Book 2 will be great for you. But if you’re looking at buying an Ultrabook, look elsewhere. This isn’t just about battery life, it’s also about portability. You can get away with carrying around a much lighter and smaller device that weighs less than two pounds. However, it doesn’t mean you’ll have more power. In fact, most of us are used to having enough juice in our laptops to last through any day without needing recharging. With the Surface Book, that’s not going to happen. You’ll need to plug into a wall outlet or use one of Microsoft’s adapters to charge it. And even then, it’ll take up quite some room. That’s why we recommend getting something like theMicrosoft Wireless Keyboard & Mouse Combo Kitinstead.

Laptop is faster, easier to lose a laptop and easier to carry on trips."," The answer to this question depends on your needs and preferences. If you are looking for a mobile device, then the choice of laptop will depend on what kind of device you want to use. For example, if you need something that can be used in multiple locations, such as at home or office, then it makes sense to go with a laptop. However, if you only plan to use one type of computer (such as an iPad), then consider buying a tablet. This way, you’ll have more flexibility when using it. You may also find yourself wanting to take advantage of some features not available on other devices. In addition, tablets tend to offer better battery life than laptops do. Finally, don’t forget about portability. Tablets allow you to move around easily without having to worry about carrying extra equipment. They make great gifts too. Do I really need a tablet? Yes, but it’s important to remember that there are many benefits to owning one. A tablet offers several advantages over a regular computer. It allows users to access information from any place they happen to be."," The main reason why I chose the Surface Book over a Macbook Air is that it has an Intel Core i5 processor and 8GB of RAM. This means it’s much faster than my old laptop, which only had 2GB.

35,milk,soda,boil faster,"which will boil faster milk,water,or soda?"," I have a question about the “boiling point” of water. It is stated that water boils at 212°F and it has been measured to be 212 degrees F. However, if you take this temperature as your starting point for calculating how much heat energy would need to raise the temperature by 1 degree Celsius, then what happens when we add more heat? What does the higher temperature do? Does it increase the amount of energy? Or do we just get less power? If so, why isn’t there an effect on the temperature? The answer is, in fact, quite simple. We are not talking about adding extra heat. Our bodies can only absorb so many calories before they start burning them off. This means that, even though our body may feel hot from time to time, its internal temperatures remain relatively constant. When added heat, however, these internal temperatures begin rising rapidly. As such, the additional warmth increases the rate of calorie burn. In other words, the addition of additional heat makes us burn more. For example, let’s say you want to lose weight."," I think it boils at a lower temperature and has less water in it. The reason for this is that the sugar molecules are more tightly packed together so they take longer to heat up. This means you have fewer of them per molecule which makes your drink taste better. Is there any difference between pasteurized or unpasteurized? There really isn’t much difference. Pasteurization kills off all bacteria but doesn’t kill off all germs. Unpasteurized, on the other hand, will still contain some germs from time to time. If you’re going to eat raw milk, make sure it’s not made with pasteurization. What do we know about how our bodies process milk? We don’t know. It’s very hard to study something like this. Milk contains lots of different kinds of bacteria. Some of these can be harmful if they’re present in large amounts. Others help us digest milk. But there’s no way to tell what kind of effect each one has. So scientists can’t even say whether drinking whole milk would actually harm us.","Milk boils faster than soda.

But it will be useful for you to know that soda is lighter and worse for your health.","Looks like milk is better, because it's greater, quicker and easier to tolerate. Soda is  and faster."," The answer to this question depends on the type of beverage you drink. If you’re drinking a soda and want something sweet, then milk will be your best bet. But if you’re looking for something with more calories than soda, then you’ll probably prefer soda. In fact, according to Dr. David Ludwig, director of nutrition at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, “[Milk] has about twice as many calories, but it’s also half as sweet.” So while it may sound like there’s no difference between Coke Zero and Coca-Cola Classic, there actually is. And that’s because sugar in both drinks contains fructose, which raises blood sugar. A study published last year found that children who drank diet sodas—sweetened by high fructose corn syrup—were less likely to gain weight over time compared with those who consumed regular soft drinks. That means kids are getting their daily dose of sugar, even though they’re not eating much fruit. How Much Is Too Much?"," I am a big fan of the idea that there are many different types of milk. The first thing to understand is that milk has two main components: fat and protein. Fat comes from animal products such as meat, dairy, or eggs. Proteins come from plant sources like nuts, seeds, beans, etc. These proteins can be found in milk, but they also exist naturally in other foods including vegetables (think spinach, kale, broccoli, cauliflower, etc). In fact, some studies have shown that dairy cows produce more protein than their beef counterparts. This means that if you want your body to build muscle, you’ll need both meat and dairy. However, this doesn’t mean that all meats should be consumed. For example, one study showed that people who ate eggs for breakfast had higher levels of cholesterol compared with those who didn’t eat eggs, while another study showed that eating bacon was associated with lower blood pressure levels. If you’re looking for an alternative source of protein, try tofu. Tofu contains high amounts of omega-3 fatty acids which may help prevent heart disease."," The two most popular beverages in the United States are milk and soda. While both have been consumed for thousands of years, they were not always considered to be one thing. In fact, there was a time when people thought that soda actually contained milk. This is because it had an alcohol content higher than milk, which made it more appealing as a beverage. However, this belief has since changed with the discovery of pasteurization methods used by Coca-Cola and Pepsi. These processes allow bacteria from milk or other liquids into the liquid so that no harmful substances can enter it. As such, these drinks now contain less sugar and fewer calories compared to their original counterparts. How Much Sugar Is Too Much? There are many different types of sugars found in food products. Some foods such as fruits and vegetables may only use about half of what we would consider “normal” sugars. Other foods, like meat products, will often have up to three times normal amounts of sugar."," 1 cup of water 2 tablespoons sugar (optional) 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon salt Directions: 1. In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt. Stir to combine. Add in the milk mixture one tablespoon at a time, mixing well after each addition. You can also use an electric mixer for this step. If you don't have one, place your bowl on top of the refrigerator while mixing. Let stand until it doubles in size, about 10 minutes. Remove from refrigerator, stir in the vanilla. Pour into prepared pan. Bake for 25 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes so that all ingredients are evenly coated. Cool completely before frosting, then remove pan from oven and let cool completely. Serve warm with whipped cream and/or sorbet. 2. To make the ganache, beat together the butter and powdered sugar. Beat in the eggs one by one. Gradually add the flour mixture, beating constantly as needed. Once incorporated, fold in the chocolate chips. Refrigerate until firm, up to 3 hours. 3.","Soda will.  Generally speaking, the boiling points of pure substances are going to be higher and sharper than those of impure substances.  In milk, the adulterants are big fatty molecules that are too large to evaporate, and in soda the adulterant is a volitile gas (disolved CO2).  So I think soda first, milk second, water last.

Note; it does matter whether you're looking at ""fastest"" in terms of time to boil based on a standard energy flux/volume ratio, energy/mass ratio, or for the lowest temperature.  Different substances need different amount of energy to reach a given temperature based on their heat capacities, and I believe that milk has the lowest heat capacity, meaning that it would take the least amount of energy to bring milk to a given temperature than it would take for the other two.  But generally, when they ask about ""boiling fastest,"" it is implied that one in searching for the substance with the lowest boiling point--and that would be soda.",0,"The milk is better than soda.

Things such as barrel length, powder speed, muzzle brakes, etc. all influence what sound is projected.  Rifles usually have slower powder than pistols. This means that the sound is generated over a longer period of time, hence the potential for more hearing damage because of the extended duration of the sound event.","Pistol is better than rifle. 
On the one hand:
1) The HK's in the rifle calibers are a lot harder on the brass than the pistol calibers. 
2) The beam rifle is also a lot harder to unlock permanently than things like the elite rifle and precision pistol. 
3) The pistol is MUCH lighter and easier to carry than a rifle also. 

On the other hand:
1) Also, it still has better range and functional accuracy than a compact pistol for defense. 
2) Holding a pistol steady is harder than a rifle. 
3) I figured the rifle would hold better groups than the pistol. 
","Pistol is better than rifle. 
On the one hand: 
1) The pistol is MUCH lighter and easier to carry than a rifle also. 
2) Transitioning to a pistol is much faster and simpler than reloading a rifle or clearing a malfunction. 
3) I would suggest that they were be better served if they were armed with an Uzis or MP-5Ks, which over more firepower and range than a pistol, but are lighter and easier to carry than a rifle.

On the other hand:
1) Also running with a rifle and then acquiring a target is typically going to be easier/faster than with a pistol. 
2) The best pistol is inferior to the worst rifle. 
3) Yes rifle cartridge ballistics are typically superior to pistol cartridge.","Looks like pistol is better, because it's easier to carry, lighter and easier. Rifle is easierfaster, faster and easier.","It's simple! Pistol is better, because it's quicker, easier to carry and lighter. But i should tell you that rifle is greater, safer and easier to shoot accurately."," The answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If your primary goal is a high quality firearm, then the choice between pistol and rifle will be obvious. However, if you want something that can do more than shoot well, but also has some versatility in terms of carrying options, then it may make sense for you to go with rifle. In fact, I would recommend going with both as they have different strengths and weaknesses. For example, pistols tend to fire at higher velocities which makes them easier to load into magazines and harder to shoot. Rifles usually require less effort from the shooter to cock them, making them better suited for hunting and target shooting. On top of that, rifles generally offer greater accuracy over long distances. This means that when shooting at longer ranges, there is no need to worry about being able to hit where you aim because you know exactly how far away you are. With pistols, however, you often find yourself having to adjust your sights after each shot so that you don’t miss any part of your target."," The pistol is a very good choice for the novice shooter, but it can be difficult to get used to. It has many different types of ammunition, and you will have to learn how they work in order to use them effectively. You may also want to consider purchasing an inexpensive rifle or shotgun as well. These are great options if you're looking to start out with your first gun. If you decide that you don't like shooting pistols, then there are plenty of other options. For example, I would recommend learning about bow hunting before trying any type of rifle. This way you'll know what kind of gun works best for you. Also, do not forget to practice at home. Shooting outdoors is much easier than indoors, so make sure you take advantage of that. Finally, remember that all guns require some amount of practice. Start off by practicing on paper targets. Then move onto clay targets after you've mastered those techniques. Once you feel comfortable shooting, try taking your skills outdoors. Practice with live ammo until you become proficient enough to shoot safely."," The pistol is a very versatile weapon that can be used for many different purposes. It has the ability to shoot through walls, and it also shoots at high speeds. This makes it ideal as an anti-armor weapon. However, this means that you need to take into account how much damage your opponent will do before using it. For example, if you are shooting from behind cover, then you should aim for their head or chest. If they have armor, then use the pistol. You may want to consider taking cover in case of enemy fire. Also, make sure not to fire too close to other players because they might get hit. Finally, try not to let them hit you. They could kill you, but only after they see you die. In most cases, however, you don’t really need to worry about them. Just keep firing until someone dies. What kind of ammo does the gun have? There are two types of ammo: soft points (bullets) and hard points. Soft points come with more damage."," The following are the different types of pistols and rifles that can be used in a gunfight. Assault Rifles These guns have high damage per shot but they do not deal much damage. They usually fire at long range with little accuracy. They also use up ammo quickly. Sniper Rifles This gun is very accurate and has great range. It shoots fast and it does not take many shots to kill someone. However, its accuracy decreases as you get closer to your target. You will need more bullets than these weapons have. Machine Guns These machines shoot heavy rounds from a distance. Their rate of fire depends on their size. If you want to hit something really fast, then this weapon would work well. But if you just want to scare someone, then this machine might not work. Shotguns, Pistols, Revolvers & Submachineguns There are several kinds of shotguns available. Some of them are powerful enough to hurt someone even though they may look like toys. Others are small and easy to hide.","pistol is a little hand held gun, a rifle is a long barrled gun that you fire from your shoulder. dont know if that is the exact definition, im not a gun nut. do an image search for rifle and then pistol and youll see the difference",1,"The pistol is better than rifle. 
On the one hand:
1) Pistol rounds are loaded with faster burning powder than rifle rounds, since pistol rounds are designed for use in shorter barrels than rifles. 
2) Pistol cartridges are faster than rifle, because you don't have to lube the pistol cases. 
3) This is because a pistol is lighter in relation to the weight of its trigger pull than a rifle. 
4) Too bad, since the pistol is a better choice than the rifle due to the reduced ammo consumption and faster firing rate. 
5) Don't mistakenly assume that because a carbine shoots a pistol cartridge it will be easier to control or that it will be safer to shoot in your apartment complex than a rifle-caliber carbine.

On the other hand:
1) However, I wouldn't say pistol shooting is harder than rifle shooting, because it's all relative. 
2) I mean nobody complains that an ST rifle is unfair, because it is superior to the Bryar pistol you start with. 
3) It's a bytch because pistol mags are harder to find and more expensive than rifle mags. 
4) she actually likes the BB rifle better than the pistol because of the trigger pull.",1," Comment: The difference is that a rifle has an action, while a pistol doesn't. A gun can fire many rounds in rapid succession without reloading ( as long as you have ammunition ) whereas a pistol only fires one round at a time. This means it's easier to shoot someone with a handgun than a rifle because they're both more accurate weapons.her is not just about how easy they are, but also what kind of environment they work in.",," The answer to this question depends on the type of weapon you are comparing it to. If your goal is to kill a lot of people with one gun, then yes, pistols and rifles will be better. However, if your aim is to shoot lots of people, then shotguns or handguns may be more effective.What about shotguns?Shotguns, like pistols, have been around for hundreds of years. They were first used in medieval Europe as hunting weapons. In fact, they still are. But today, most hunters use rifles."

And that's why it's important to get her out there as soon as possible. 981The media should start calling it ""debate"" instead of debate."," The answer to that question depends on your definition of “better.” If you define it as being more effective in achieving the goals set by a president or party, then yes, Nixon was better. But if you’re looking for something else, like whether he did any good at all, he’s not much better. He left office with an approval rating below 50 percent and his party badly split over how best to deal with Watergate. In short, it’s hard to say what Nixon’s legacy will be. His presidency has been marked by some very bad decisions, but also many successes — including the end of segregation in public schools and the creation of Medicare and Medicaid. And while there are plenty who would argue that those accomplishments were largely thanks to him, they can’t be said to have happened without him. So let’s take a look back at the past four decades and see where we stand today. Here are five things I think about each president. 1. Lyndon Johnson vs. Richard M. Nixon. This one isn’t so easy to answer.","Nixon is better than Reagan.
There hasn't been a good republican president since Ike.  Nixon was a crook.  Ford a joke.  Reagan had the most corrupt administration in history, worse than Nixon. GHWBush?  Ha - read my lips, 1 termer.  No, the best republican values president since Ike was.
But he could propose cutting taxes, and increasing defense spending.  What Congress did after that was their own actions.  And in '89 - it collapsed.)  Reagan could communicate with the people much better than Nixon, Ford, or Carter. He reminded us that we were an exceptional country - appealed to that horribly base instinct of patriotism - and was able to get enough support so that Congress would do what had to be done.","Nixon is better than reagan. 
On the one hand:
1) Nixon definitely belongs on this list, however, I would say he was better than Bush, Reagan, and possibly Eisenhower. 
2) Nixon was always clearly the front runner throughout the contest because of his superior organization and he easily defeated both Reagan and Rockefeller. 
3) That said, Courtwright's is my favorite political history of the post-Nixon era-much better, for example, than Sean Wilentz's Age of Reagan . 

On the other hand:
1) It's akin to having Reagan invade Vietnam to prove he could have run the war better than LBJ and Richard Nixon. 
2) [ 62 ] Sources within Washington reported that Reagan caused greater concern for the Nixon campaign than Rockefeller. 
3) Few knew Ronald Reagan better than Ed Rollins, who served in the administrations of Presidents Nixon, Ford and Reagan, including serving two tours of duty at the highest level of the White House as assistant to the president and White House political director. 
","Nixon is better than reagan. 
On the one hand: 
1) Clinton Worse Than Nixon . 
2) Nixon was probably smarter than Reagan but Nixon was troubled by unfair criticism and Reagan wasn't. 
3) Reagan, H.W., and W were all worse than Nixon .

On the other hand:
1) He's moderately liberal (somewhere between Jimmy Carter and Lyndon Johnson), moderately honest (better than Nixon and Johnson, worse than Carter and Bush), and moderately wishy washy (probably better than Bush and Carter, worse than Nixon and Reagan). 
2) I think neither Nixon nor Bush ever got over the feeling that they were better than Reagan, smarter or whatever. 
3) Some turned out better than we'd hoped or expected (Nixon comes to mind), others were spot-on or worse (Reagan, Bush I).","It seems like nixon is better than reagan because it is smarter, faster, performance.",I would prefer to use nixon because it's faster and smarter. Reagan is  and greater.," I think the answer to this question depends on what you consider a “better” president. If you’re looking for someone who was more successful than his predecessor, then Reagan would be your best choice. But if you’re looking for somebody with an even greater capacity for accomplishment, then Nixon, of course, comes out ahead. In fact, it seems that most people are drawn towards Nixon. He has been described as “the greatest president in American history,” and he certainly was. His presidency saw major changes in our country – from civil rights legislation to Medicare to Medicaid. And while many Americans may not agree with all of these changes, they were undeniably positive changes. The fact is, however, that there have always been negative aspects associated with any president, no matter how great their accomplishments. For example, President Obama had some very good moments during his first term, but overall he did little to help improve the lives of Americans. This isn’t just because he’s black. It’s also because, despite being black, he didn’t do enough to address racial inequality."," The first debate between Richard M. Nixon, the Republican nominee for president, and Ronald Reagan, his Democratic opponent, was held on Oct. 24, 1968. It aired live from New York City at 8 p.m. Eastern time. In a speech that lasted more than an hour, Mr. Nixon attacked President Lyndon B. Johnson over civil rights legislation, accusing him of “using race to divide us.” He also criticized Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, who had been critical of him. “I am not running against anyone because I have any particular racial or ethnic group in mind,” he said. “I’m running against someone who’s trying to use racism as a wedge issue in this campaign.” But it would be wrong to say that Mr. Nixon’s campaign message did not resonate with black voters. According to exit polls, they went overwhelmingly for him, while white voters split their tickets almost evenly. A version of this article appears in print on, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: ‘Silent Majority’ Is Still With Nixon."," The first presidential debate between Richard M.

The president has also been criticized for his handling of Hurricane Maria and other natural disasters. Trump said he was “very proud” to have visited Texas after Harvey but that it would be a mistake if federal aid were not extended there. He later backtracked, saying he’d spoken with Gov. Greg Abbott (R) about how to help those affected by Harvey. In an interview on CBS’s Face the Nation, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended Trump’s response as being appropriate given the scope of the disaster. She cited comments from FEMA Director Brock Long who told reporters Friday that the administration is prepared “to do whatever we need to do.” “We are doing everything possible under the law,” she said. “And I think it’s important to remember that, you know, this President came into office pledging to rebuild our country and make America great again.” On Saturday, Trump tweeted praise for Puerto Rico’s governor Ricardo Rosselló (R), who declared a state of emergency over the island’s dire financial situation.",Politically they both scored great landslides in their bids for the Presidency.  I think that Reagan would have took Nixon in a knock down drag out fight as well as would have beat him politically as well.  Reagan as an actor played his greatest role as a politician.,1,,1," I think the reason Trump is doing so well with women voters is because he has been saying things that are not politically correct for decades. He was never going to be able to get away from his own words and actions. If you don't like what he's doing, then vote against him. But if you're voting for him anyway, that's just plain stupid.",,"  The answer to that question depends on the definition of “better”. If you mean more efficient and less expensive, then yes, but if you want something better, then no. I think it’s a matter of perspective. When we look at what was done in the past, it seems like there were many things that could have been done, but weren’t. We don’t know how much money would be saved by doing those things, so we’re not going to do them. "
38,kennedy,nixon,,How much different would the world be if Bobby Kennedy had been elected president in 1968 instead of Nixon?," The answer is not much. It was a very close election, and Nixon won by about 1.5 million votes. But it wasn’t close. And it’s worth noting that even though he lost to Kennedy, Johnson did win reelection with an approval rating above 60 percent for his first two years as president. In fact, Johnson’s numbers were so good that, at one point, they actually outpaced those of Nixon. So what happened? Well, there are several factors. One important factor was the fact that Kennedy’s popularity fell after the Bay of Pigs invasion. Another significant factor, which I will discuss below, was Lyndon B. Johnson’s. He didn’t run on any kind of platform other than “peace through strength.” His campaign slogan was, “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself,” but this phrase became synonymous with weakness when Vietnam escalated into all-out war. There are, however, some reasons why Johnson’s ratings improved over time. First, he got more credit from historians for being able to get things done during the Cuban missile crisis — something many people thought impossible."," The answer to that question depends on who you ask. For me, it comes down to the fact that I think Nixon was a much more effective president in his first term. He had an agenda and he knew how to get things done. Kennedy, by contrast, did not. His presidency lasted only two years. And while some of Kennedy’s policies were good for the country, most weren’t. In fact, many of them would have been disastrous if they hadn’t already happened. But what about the other side? What do we know from their records? Well, let’s start with Nixon. First, there are three big reasons why Nixon didn’t work as well as Kennedy. First off, he wasn’t really trying to. Second, he couldn’t keep up with the pace of change at all. Third, he never tried hard enough to make sure people understood where he stood on things. There weren’t any “triangulation” issues like there were under JFK. So here’s my question: If you’re going to be president, should you try harder or not? Or maybe just not try.","Kennedy is better than Nixon.
And it has stayed that way with one obvious notable exception since then,"" said Stein.  The famous first televised debate between Nixon and Kennedy in 1960 had, as Stein puts it, a ""huge, huge impact"" on the role of politics in television for the rest of the decade.  ""For those of us who were listening on the radio, it sure seemed as though Nixon won.  But Nixon looked so much worse than Kennedy. 
And I got to thinking: maybe the Republicans can only win when their candidate is dumber than his or her opponent!  (Obviously, the reverse isn't true, for while people seem to expect their Democrats to be smarter than their Republicans, being dumber than one's opponent is not enough to guarantee a Republican victory.  Witness, for example, Clinton versus anyone.)  Nixon was thought to be smarter than Kennedy. ","Kennedy is better than nixon. 
On the one hand:
1) I was five years old in 1960 and I wanted Kennedy to win the presidential election because he was much better looking than Nixon. 
2) ROBERT MACNEIL, JOURNALIST: When the networks offered a debate, Kennedy immediately said yes because he was sure he could do better than Nixon. 
3) The first debate offered the greatest contrast: Tanned, telegenic Kennedy made a much better visual impression than pale, makeup free, stubble-chinned Nixon, who was recovering from the flu. 

On the other hand:
1) People complained that they thought Nixon got better play out of it than Kennedy. 
2) Going back to the first one ever televised in 1960, those who listened on the radio actually thought Nixon did better than Kennedy. 
3) So, of course, was his labor on health care (where Richard Nixon had a better political track record than the Kennedy administration) and his last decision to keep looking life in the face for as long as he had breath. 
","Kennedy is better than nixon. 
On the one hand: 
1) Just for the record, I voted for Kennedy in the 1968 California Democratic primary so I would agree that, by that time, he was better then his opponent, Gene McCarthy and certainly far superior to the mentally unstable Richard Nixon. 
2) But Nixon looked so much worse than Kennedy. 
3) If Jack Kennedy was not a worse person than Lyndon Johnson or Richard Nixon, he wasn't a better man either.

On the other hand:
1) Eisenhower was better on civil rights than Kennedy. 
2) Nixon was thought to be smarter than Kennedy. 
3) You ranked Kennedy worse than Nixon.","Looks like kennedy is better, because it's cooler, easier to look at and easier. But it will be useful for you to know that nixon is smarter, easier and better for civil rights.","smth wrong in answer generation, please try again"," I think it was the first time in history that a president had to be impeached. And he did it. He got impeached by Congress. It wasn’t just one vote. The House of Representatives voted for him and then they sent his impeachment up to the Senate. They didn’t have any power over impeachment. But they could still vote against him. So there were two votes. One vote, which would have been unanimous, but not necessarily with all Republicans voting yes, and another vote, where you can only get two-thirds of the Senate if you’re on your own. That means Nixon needed four votes from Republicans. If he’d gotten those votes, he wouldn’t have faced an impeachment, because they’d already passed the resolution. That’s why it’s so important now — we need more people who are willing to stand up. We don’t want this country to go back into the dark ages. It’s going to take courage now. You can’t do anything without courage. Do you feel like there’s too much focus on Trump right now? Or does it make sense to talk about what happened during Watergate?"," The most famous case of a president being impeached is that of Richard Nixon. He was accused by the House Judiciary Committee in 1974 and convicted on two articles of impeachment for obstructing justice during Watergate. In his final days as president, he resigned from office before any charges were brought against him. His successor, Gerald Ford, pardoned him after an investigation found no evidence to support these charges. But there are other cases where presidents have been impeached. For example, John Adams faced trial over accusations of treason while serving as president. After losing the vote, Congress acquitted him, but it did so with one condition: they wanted all future votes taken into account when determining whether or not to remove Adams. This meant that if another vote had gone Adams' way, then he would still be President. However, this wasn't enough to satisfy Adams, who decided to resign instead. And then, there's Bill Clinton. While Clinton has never actually been charged with anything, he's certainly come close several times."," The most famous political assassination in American history was the murder of President John F. Kennedy, and it is a story that has been told many times over the years. It seems like every time we hear about it, there are always new theories to try and explain what happened. One thing that everyone agrees on though, is that this event changed America forever. This episode will look at how the events surrounding the death of JFK impacted our country for years after his death. We also explore some other major issues such as race relations during the Civil Rights Movement, the Vietnam War, Watergate, and more. Episode Notes In addition to discussing the assassination, we’ll be looking into the aftermath of JFK’s death, including the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, among others. We’ll also discuss the role played by media coverage of these events, particularly from the perspective of those who were directly affected by them. Finally, we’ll examine why conspiracy theorists have become so popular since 9/11."," would have been able to do that. I think the most important thing is that we are not going to be a country where people feel like they can get away with doing things because of their skin color. We need to make sure that everybody feels safe and protected in this country. And that’s why I’m so proud of my friend here tonight who has worked for decades on behalf of civil rights. He was one of those heroes from our history. So thank you very much for being here. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) COOPER: Senator Sanders, thanks again for joining us. You know, we’ve had some questions about your foreign policy positions, but let me just ask you, what does it mean when someone says “radical Islam”? Do you believe that? What exactly did he mean?

It means there is no freedom of religion anywhere in the world today.",Nixon did a couple of things that Bobby wouldn't have done. He took the dollar off of the silver standard and allowed it to float which devalued it. He also allowed Private ownership of gold which took investment money out of the markets. He also was one of those supply side economic Repuglicans that tried and failed to boost the economy. I don't think that Bobby would have done any of those things. I am not sure what he would have done about the Viet Nam war but I don't think he would have turned tail and run. That is about the only thing that Nixon did that I could agree with.

It was a great year for civil rights and women’s rights. But we were also living through one of the most horrific periods of racial violence this country has ever seen.

I think the biggest problem with this is that it doesn't really matter who wins - it's all about how many points they get in each race. The only way to stop a driver winning more than one race at any given time is for him or her not to finish on top of their class. If you do that, then you're just giving them an extra point and that's it. And if you don't have enough points, your best chance of finishing first is probably going to be by being able to score as few points as possible without running out of fuel. So what happens when someone gets two points? They can still win, but they're unlikely to. It's like having a game where there are three players and everyone has exactly equal chances of winning. But if no player ever finishes ahead of anyone else, then there's nothing left to do. That's why we call it ""zero-sum games"". In other words, if you can't beat anyone, then nobody can. That means that whoever ends up second behind another car isn't likely to win."," I have a friend who has an f1 car and he says that the engine in his car is much more powerful then the one in my car.

2) Ferrari is a better car than Renault and KR is not any worse driver than FA. 
3) To be honest , I don't see the Renault engine being inferior to either Mercedes or Ferrari.

On the other hand:
1) Better than Merc or Red Bull and this time faster than Ferrari. 
2) Now the same Renault is a much faster and better car than Ferrari. 
3) And now the same Renault is a much faster and better car than Ferrari.","Looks like ferrari is better, because it's faster, cleverer and quicker. But i should tell you that renault is faster, quicker and downforce.",I would prefer to use ferrari because it's  and lighter. Renault is  and stronger.," The answer to that question depends on what you think of the two teams. If you’re a fan of one team and want your car to be competitive, then you’ll probably prefer Ferrari. But if you’re more interested in winning than being competitive with your car, then Renault will do just fine. In fact, this was exactly how I felt about my new car. It wasn’t perfect, but it did everything I wanted it to. And that’s all I could ask for.

The other thing that I think we need to do as well is make sure that our fans understand what we’re doing on track. We don’t want them to feel like they’re watching something that’s not real. They should know what’s going on. It’s very important for us to get this right. If people see someone driving around at high speed, they might assume it’s fake. But if you’re actually racing against somebody who’s really fast, then there’s no reason why you’d ever believe that."," in the last two races of the season and it is a very interesting battle to watch. The reason why I am so excited about this race weekend for both teams is that they are going into their final test before the start of the season. This means that we will see how each team performs on track during the first part of the season, which could be quite interesting. For example, if Mercedes can get its car working properly at Barcelona, then there may not be much difference between them and Ferrari. If not, then who knows? It would certainly make for an exciting race. In terms of qualifying, things were pretty tight with only three drivers getting through without any problems. Fernando Alonso was quickest ahead of Sebastian Vettel in second place, but he had problems keeping up with Kimi Raikkonen in third. Sergio Perez also struggled against his teammate Lewis Hamilton, while Valtteri Bottas did well out front despite having some issues with qualifying. As usual, qualifying has been dominated by Red Bull as Daniel Ricciardo took pole position from Max Verstappen."," to be the first team in F1 history to win three consecutive constructors' and drivers' titles since Ayrton Senna won five straight from 1988-1990. The Maranello outfit has also been crowned world champions for a record fifth time with Vettel winning his third title at last year's Japanese Grand Prix. He is now on course to become only the second driver after Michael Schumacher - who won four successive championships between 2000-07 - to complete that feat. Vettel's victory was Mercedes' seventh of this season but it had not yet secured its fourth title. It will go into next week's race as one point behind Red Bull Racing which leads by 10 points going into Sunday's race. Media playback is not supported on this device Sebastian Vettel wins Japan GP - BBC Sport chief analyst Eddie Jordan In terms of championship points, Mercedes are just two ahead of Ferrari, whose lead over McLaren remains unchanged following their weekend test at Suzuka.","After watching Kimi Raikkonen coming from the back of the grid at the Bahrain Grand Prix, I believe the McLaren-Mercedes team have to be at least co-favourites with Renault. However, I'll give McLaren the nod to capture the 2006 constructors' title.",0,"The ferrari is better than renault. 
On the one hand:
1) Ferrari look pretty dominant, about 3-5 tenths faster than the rest, while Renault look to be within a few tenths of Mclaren and BMW, although its hard to tell because Alonso never had much opportunity to show his pace without someone ahead of him. 
2) And even worse, they're not even thorough in their stupidity because they never bothered Ferrari and yet, I'd say that for most people here, red and white is much more a reminder of Marlboro than black and gold can be of JPS. 
3) I consider 2006 Alonso's greatest deed, because in 2006 Ferrari was generally better than Renault and even then he won over M Schumacher . 
4) MAS is only 6th because the Ferrari was so superior to the Mercedes & Renault. 
5) Spaniard Alonso, who won two world championships in 2005 and 2006, said he can be confident about his future because he comes to Ferrari ""much better prepared than when I arrived at Renault"".

On the other hand:
1) I think he would be able to create a buffer zone, since I think Williams is currently a better car than Ferrari. 
2) It might be even better than a red screaming Ferrari, because a high-end sports car can make people jealous, whereas that little pod only makes people smile. 
3) Renault are having a better year than anyone predicted and with Ross Brawn and Schumacher at Mercedes, Ferrari should indeed be worried because if won't take much and they could find themselves scrapping with Force India. 
4) Something to remember about Petrov/Alonso at Abu-Dhabi last year is that Renault were significantly faster than anyone else down the straghts because they had a better F-Duct & had gambled on a lower downforce setting & had run a better pit strategy than Ferrari. 
5) @Biggsy - The assumption that 2016 Renault engine is better than 2015 Ferrari just because RB took the former is a big jump.",,,,
40,basketball,volleyball,,How are basketball and volleyball similar? How are they different?," The two sports have similar rules for the most part, but there is one major difference between them. Basketball has a three-point line in each half of every game, while volleyball uses an eight-point line. This means that if you shoot from inside your own half, you’re going to be shooting at least eight feet away from the basket when it counts. Volleyball also allows players who miss free throws to come back into play after making their first attempt. In basketball, this can lead to some very exciting moments where someone misses a shot only because he or she was trying so hard not to. But with volleyball, it’s much more common for a player to just give up on attempting a shot. If you miss, then you’ll never get another chance unless you make it. And that’s why many people love volleyball. It’s such a fun game to watch. So how do these games compare as far as skill levels? Well, let’s take a look at both men’s and women’s basketball. Here’s what we found: Men’s Basketball: As you might expect, men dominate here."," The answer to this question depends on the type of basketball you play. If you’re a power player who likes to run and jump around in your own zone, then Volleyball might be more suited for you. But if you’re looking for something that requires some skill or coordination, then volleyball may not be as good an option. It can take quite a bit of practice before you’ll get used to playing with the ball at all. And even then, it will still require lots of practice. So while it’s great fun to play basketball, don’t expect to become a pro overnight. You need time to learn how to move without it, develop proper technique, and build up enough strength so that you won’t have any problems when moving laterally. What are the best ways to improve my game? There are many different things you could do to help improve your game. Here are just a few: Practice – This one seems obvious, but I think most people forget about it. Most players know they should practice, but few actually do.","Basketball is better than volleyball.
Make sure you have plenty of card capacity.  Use the centre focus point, and shoot small bursts of 3-4 shots.  Forget about trying to use flash.  Basketball moves faster than volleyball!! I beg to differ ;) But then again I haven?t really shot basketball.
Things like: That every adult works in real estate.  That dads dress like 12-year-old grommets.  That Hollywood is pretty close but also impossibly distant.  That volleyball players do better for themselves than football and basketball stars.","Basketball is better than volleyball. 
On the one hand:
1) By the way, basketball players (male and female) have to move a lot faster and cover a lot more distance than Volleyball players yet they wear their spandex shorts UNDER their baggy/loose uniform. 
2) And to think that the state of the basketball league is vastly better than that of the soccer, handball and volleyball women's leagues which are essentially completely amateur. 
3) With the exception of women's beach volleyball there is no greater sport than basketball and I am a basketball junkie. 

On the other hand:
1) ""Volleyball clicked for me faster than basketball did,"" said the 5-foot-10 left side, who competed in the Cats 16U girls club volleyball tournament in Brandon over the weekend. 
2) ""I figured volleyball was a little better conditioning than golf was for basketball,"" said Nydegger, who had played golf for the Spartans in previous seasons. 
3) Jen's volleyball career started in 5th grade when she was approached by a club coach and saw aspects to the sport she liked better than the physical nature of basketball. 
","Basketball is better than volleyball. 
On the one hand: 
1) Basketball moves faster than volleyball!! 
2) With the exception of women's beach volleyball there is no greater sport than basketball and I am a basketball junkie. 
3) We dive harder than basketball players, we contort our bodies more, and everyone I know would rather play in spandex.

On the other hand:
1) That volleyball players do better for themselves than football and basketball stars. 
2) The volleyball was MUCH better then basketball and we played with four students from La Salle volleyball team! 
3) All in all, Football (like Basketball, like Waterpolo) is inferior to Rugby Union or Volleyball, because one can bring the family to follow the latter group more or less everywhere around the world.","I would prefer to use basketball because it's faster, easier and younger. Volleyball is bigger, lighter and faster.","I came to the conclusion that basketball is better, because it's greater, faster and younger. But you should know that volleyball is  and better for themselves."," The answer to this question depends on the type of sport you are playing and how much time you have available. If you want a quick game that can be played in less than an hour, then basketball will probably give you more bang for your buck. However, if you prefer a longer game, volleyball may be better suited as it requires some skill and practice but also has its own set of challenges. Volleyball players need to keep their balance while running around the court and they must use both hands at all times when playing. This makes them very good at passing the ball back and forth between each other. It takes quite a bit of coordination to play volleyball, so make sure you do not get injured during practice. You should never forget about your health because injuries happen even with proper training. How long does it take to learn volleyball? There are many different ways to learn. One way would be to start off by learning one simple technique such as “pass the ball” or “dribble dribble”."," The NCAA Men’s Division I basketball tournament is the culmination of a long and arduous journey for college basketball. It began in 1939, with only eight teams competing. In its first year, it was played as an eight-team event before expanding to 16 schools over the next two decades. Today, there are 128 teams, including 32 automatic qualifiers who receive bids based on their regular-season records. This year’s men’s field includes four newcomers from last season’s Final Four. They join Duke, North Carolina, Villanova and Michigan State — all ranked among the top five nationally this season. Duke has been one of the most consistent programs in recent years, while Penn State, which won the Big Ten title last season, returns nearly everyone that made up the team’s starting lineup last year. Here’s how each team stacks up: 1. Duke Blue Devils (29-0) | Last week: No. 1 With three straight wins against top-20 opponents, Duke enters Saturday’s game at Kentucky undefeated after winning nine games by double digits."," The NCAA Men’s and Women’s basketball tournaments are the two most watched sporting events in America. With over 200 million viewers per year, college sports is a major part of our culture. However, there has been an increase in popularity for other forms of sports. For example, soccer (football) was added to the Olympics after it had only existed as a spectator sport since 1904. In addition, baseball became popular during World War II when many soldiers were stationed overseas. Today, professional football (soccer) is one of America’s top three sports, while hockey ranks fifth among all U.S. team sports. College Football vs. Soccer While both collegiate athletics and pro football have grown tremendously over recent decades, they still face some significant challenges. One problem that faces them is their lack of popularity. According to Sports Illustrated, “Americans don’t watch more than four hours of live television every week.” This means that fans who want to see games on TV will often turn to streaming services like Netflix or Amazon Prime. Another challenge facing these new sports is how much money each individual fan spends at games."," The following are the most common reasons for a player to choose one sport over another. They can be used as an indicator of how much time they spend playing basketball and volleyball compared with other sports. For example, if you have been playing soccer since age 5, then it is likely that you will play more football than basketball. However, if your favorite team plays in basketball, soccer, volleyball, tennis, track & field, etc. but not football, then you may prefer football. If this was true when you were younger, now it’s probably not. You like sports because they’re fun – This could mean liking sports, watching sporting events, participating in organized activities, going on trips, etc., all things which make life enjoyable. It also means being able to enjoy yourself while doing it. In addition, there are many people who love both sports equally, so why would anyone want to switch sports? Sports provide social interaction – There has always been some form of socializing involved in sport.","Both are played on a court with a ball, a net, and 5 players. In both if you  send the ball out of bounds the ball is given to the other team. In basketball the idea is to put the ball in the net while in volleyball, it has to go over the net. in basketball the players can roam the entire court, but in volleyball they have to stay on their own side. In volleyball you serve the ball to the other team while in Basketball you pass the ball to your teamate. In volleyball the other team serves the ball to you, in Basketball you have to steal it from the other team. In Baketball you play a timed games, but in volleyball the games are regulated by the points scored. And the match isn't over until the first team wins two games. In basketball the team with the most points at the end of the final period wins, in volleyball the first team to 15 and leading by two points wins.",1,,1," The answer is that the two sports have a lot in common. Both involve physical contact between players on both sides of the ball. They also share some basic rules about how to play them. In basketball, for example, you can shoot from anywhere within 10 feet of the basket, but only if you’re inside your own three-point line. You can’t drive into an open lane unless you’ve already made it there. And while there aren’t any official rules, most teams will try their best not to foul anyone who gets close enough to make contact.",," The answer to this question depends on the sport. If you are a volleyball player, then yes, it is. Volleyball has been around for thousands of years, and its popularity continues to grow. But if you want to play basketball, then no, not really. In fact, there isn’t much difference between playing football or baseball compared to volleyball. Basketball players have more muscle mass and can move their bodies faster in order to get off shots. They also tend to be taller and stronger than soccer players."

Posted by: Anonymous | May 12, 2014 1:58:58 AM @anonymous... If you want to know how much money people spend on their cars, go look at the average price of new cars sold here in Canada last month. In Ontario, we had sales of over 61,000 vehicles and total vehicle production was about 73,000 vehicles. This means that every single car sold, there were more buyers buying these cars then ever before. So if you think Canadians don't drive much, just wait until the prices drop here."," The new Audi A4, which is expected to go on sale in the US and Europe this year, will be a significant improvement over its predecessor, but it won’t have quite as much of an edge as some might think. In fact, it’s not even close. While the BMW i8 has been around for several years, the Audi A4 was introduced just last year. It’s still new, so we don’t know how well it’ll hold up against other cars that are more established or popular. But if you look at the numbers, you’ll see that the A5 does pretty well. Let’s start with the numbers. According to Kelley Blue Book, the A6 ranks first among all luxury sedans by sales volume. That means that, according to KBB, there were about 41,000 units sold during the month of September 2017. That’s nearly double what the BMW 328d had sold, and almost three times what the Mercedes-Benz GLC sold. And that’s before any discounts kick in. What’s more, the A3 ranked second only to the Mercedes S-Class when it comes to total sales.

On the one hand:
1) It handles better than the Lexus and Volvo S60R, is faster than both the BMW 3-series and the Audi A4, and costs thousands of dollars less than all of them. 
2) Without having driven it back-to-back with its competitive set, I'd say the IS250 is probably about midpack: better than the current G25 and possibly the Mercedes C250, but not as good as the BMW 328, Cadillac ATS 2.0T, or Audi A4.

We have to talk about millions of cars which will be sold in China over the next 10 years. This means that there will be many different models from all manufacturers competing for customers there. And this competition has been going on since long before the Chinese government started its “Made In China” campaign. It was already happening when I first visited Beijing back in 2008. But it really took off after Xi Jinping became president last year. He launched his campaign against corruption by making companies register with the government. Companies were required to disclose their ownership structure and share information regarding how they spent money abroad. They also had to pay taxes on profits made overseas. These rules would affect every company operating in China. So what did these new regulations mean for carmakers? Well, as you can imagine, things got very complicated."," and BMW vs Mercedes. The first thing to note is that the new car will be a lot more expensive than its predecessor. It has been rumoured for some time now that it would cost around £60,000 or even more, but this was never confirmed by either company until now. This price tag also includes all of the standard features such as Bluetooth, satellite radio, heated seats, power windows etc. However, there are several other things which have not changed from previous models. For example, the interior design remains very similar with leather seats in both cars being available on both. There is no option for an automatic transmission like we saw last year so you can only choose between manual or CVT. In addition, the engine options remain unchanged – petrol engines only, diesel engines, hybrid electric powertrains, turbo diesels, direct injection turbocharged engines. All models come with two airbags, one front side curtain airbag and one seat belt pretensioner. Both vehicles feature a full colour digital instrument cluster and a panoramic sunroof."," to the point where they can be considered a luxury brand. The new car is expected to go on sale in Europe and North America next year. It will have an all-electric powertrain, which will allow it to travel at up to 150 miles per hour for about 100 miles. Image A prototype of the electric vehicle that Audi’s designers are working on. CreditGordon Welters for The New York Times Mr. Müller said he was not worried by the prospect of competition from Tesla, because his company had already developed its own battery technology. He also noted that Tesla has been building cars with batteries made by Panasonic since 2010. “We don’t need any other suppliers,” Mr. Müller said. “Everything we do here comes directly out of our own research.” But he acknowledged that there were still challenges ahead. For instance, while the technology behind lithium-ion batteries, known as LiFePO4, is relatively new, many companies around the world are developing similar batteries.","if its your FIRST car..i wouldn't get anything high end..the cost to fix these cars are bank! but im a current owner of a is250..and i drove the previous model..the is300..my current car is250 is very nice it seems to pull like the is300. if you wanna impress your friends the is350 anit bad, rwd anit all that bad and plus its manual. the is350 only comes in auto.

You can always add on some extras later down the road when she gets tired of driving mine around.Comment: For starters, they're both cars from different eras. A lot of older models were built in Germany, while newer ones are made here. This means that their engines are basically identical. They've been pretty much interchangeable since the early 80s. There was no need to change anything else about them."," The new BMW 3 Series is a great car and one of the best cars in its class. But does it beat out the Mustang for top spot as the most powerful American sports car? We decided to find out. To test our theory, we took two different versions of each car, which were identical except that they had been modified with an extra turbocharger, bigger brakes, larger rear tires and more power. In total, these modifications added up to about 500 horsepower over stock models. Then we put them through their paces on some very challenging road courses around the world. Our goal was not only to see how well the cars would do but also to determine if there are any differences between them. After all, it’s hard enough finding a good comparison when you don’t have access to both cars. Here are the results from our test: Winner: BMW 3 Series.

Both cars can go from 0 to 60 mph in under 7 seconds with ease. You do realize that this car will never get any kind of government subsidy, right? It would cost too much money just to build it. And if you want to buy one, you’re going to need some serious cash flow because it’s likely you’ll only sell about 500 units per year.

In addition there are also weather conditions such as wind direction and temperature differences between them. This means that even if one guy was able to go faster than his opponent he could only do so because of those things combined together. So while I'm sure some people will say "" Well why did he beat him? He had better technology! """," and the rest of them are not going to be able to compete with that. I think that is a very good point. The problem for BMW in Europe (and probably most other countries) is that they have been selling cars at high prices because their customers want them. They don’t need to sell as many cars if people buy them, but since there aren’t enough buyers who can afford BMWs then it makes sense to keep making more expensive cars. And that’s what they’re doing. But it’s also true that this strategy has worked well so far. If you look back over the last few years, sales of new vehicles in Germany were up by about 10% per year while car production was down by around 5%. So there’s no reason why demand can’t continue rising even after the end of the current boom. In fact, we might see some growth from now until 2020 when the next generation will come out. This means that we’ll get another decade of low interest rates before inflation starts getting out of hand.","If just comparing a ford mustang against a BMW then it would have to be the BMW, being a former owner of both I can say that easily. The mustang has many short comings such as brake fade at high speeds, road noise, loose steering at high speeds as well as many more. However the BMW has a few short comings as well higher price tag (but resale is high to), service cost more, aftermarket parts a little more expensive thats about all I can think of. The ride quality in a BMW no matter what series is better than any other car I have owned. And at high speeds lets say 80 MPH you cannot feel the road with a BMW, the mustang gets a little loose. I dont know I would choose the BMW over the mustang any day. But if I had to choose I would wait for the new 2007 toyota supra, or if price is an issue then look at the nissan 350, or if you want good styling then a hyundai tiburon is cool to. Just depends on what you want out of the car. Dont just settle because you think its cool, take into consideration things as a back seat will you need it ever, how much room do you need, gas milage, reliablity, cost think about everything before you buy or else you may be unhappy in the long run.",1,,1,"  The answer to this question depends on your car and the type of driving you do.

43,php,python,web development,Is Python programming language better suited for web development than PHP?," I have been using PHP since the early days of its release and it has always felt like a good fit to me. However, as time went on there were many times when I wanted something more powerful or had some other reason that made me want to switch over to Python. In this article we will take a look at what makes Python so great for web development. We are going to see how you can use Python in your own projects with no coding experience whatsoever. You may be surprised by just how easy it is to get started writing code without any prior knowledge about programming. This guide should help you learn Python, but also give you ideas on where to go from there. What does Python mean to you? If you’re looking for an introduction into programming, then perhaps one of my favorite books would be Programming in Java. It covers all aspects of Java including classes, interfaces, packages, etc. The book was written before Java came out which means it’s still relevant today."," I think it depends on the project. If you are working with a large project that has many developers and needs to be able to run multiple instances of your application then PHP might not be as good as Python. However, if you’re doing something small like an online shop or blog, where only one person can use it, then PHP’s performance will probably be fine. Also, there are some great tools out there which make development in PHP much easier such as Webpack and Gulp. For example, when developing a web application, it’s often useful to have separate modules so that each developer doesn’t need to worry about installing all these different versions of modules. This way, they don’t end up having to install them all. What do you recommend people who want to learn more about programming languages do? The best way to get started learning new things is by reading books written by experts rather than just watching tutorials. You should also read technical articles from websites such as Stack Overflow and Technorati.","Php is better than python for web develoment.

On the one hand:
1) I love Python, and it's certainly a better choice than PHP if performance is important, but if you really care about performance, you need one of C++ (OK), Haskell (better), or C (best). 
2) In a lot of ways its easier to pick up on than PHP. 
3) discounting those differences, I found that python was orders of magnitude easier, briefer to code, and got the job done faster than curl working concurrently (on windows/apache2, mind you) because curl and php has weird issues, even when running php as fastcgi . 

On the other hand: 
1) I'd like a good PHP and Perl version as well as a better Python version (the python version isn't producing acurate output and is WAY slower than is reasonable). 
2) I think PHP is a better choice for web applications than Python. 
3) In various benchmarks, its slower than Ruby and PHP.

But i should tell you that php is faster, easier and easier to pick up.","After much thought, I realized that  python is better, because it's faster and friendlier. But it will be useful for you to know that php is easier to administrate and maintain and better to write cross platform code always."," I am not a programmer and have no idea what the difference is. But if you are interested in web development then Python will be your best choice. It has many advantages over PHP. Here are some of them: You can use it to develop any kind of application that requires programming skills. This includes games, video games etc. The code base is very large so there is less chance of bugs being introduced by changing it. There are more libraries available than with PHP which means you don’t need to learn all those different ones. If you want to do something really complicated like an e-commerce site using MySQL, then php would probably be better. However, if you’re just looking for simple applications where you won’t get into too much trouble, then python might be a good choice too. Why should someone choose one language over another when they could both work well together? Well, this depends on how big your project is, but generally speaking it’s easier to write small projects in python."," The PHP programming language is a very popular and widely used web application framework. It has been around since the early 1990s but it was only in 2008 that its popularity really took off. In this article, we will look at how to use PHP, Python, Ruby on Rails, or any other framework you may want to use. We are going to cover all of these frameworks from beginner level through advanced level. This article assumes no prior knowledge about programming, so if you have never programmed before, please read our Introduction to Programming article. If you’re looking for some good tips on developing your own website, check out our website Development Tips & Tricks section. What makes PHP different than Python? There are many reasons why people choose one over another. Some say it’s because they like their code more organized, others prefer functional programming. But there are also differences between them. For example, when I first started learning Ruby, my main reason was speed. However, as I’ve gotten better with it, I find myself using it more."," The first thing I did was to compare the performance of both languages on a simple benchmark that measures how long it takes for two programs to do something in Python. This is an example from my blog post about using PyPy with NumPy: In this case, the difference between PHP and Python is not very significant. However, there are some interesting differences when comparing them at runtime. For example, if you want to call a function without arguments, then you have to use more than one method call. If your program calls many methods but only uses one, or even just two, methods, then you’ll get better performance. But if you need to pass arguments into each method, then you’re going to be much slower because it’s harder to find out which method should take care of it. Another important point here is that we can see that the time taken by the interpreter to execute our code depends heavily on what kind of data we’re trying to process. We could try to optimize this, but we’ll leave it as an exercise for you."," and you have a basic understanding of the fundamentals of web development.

First, we want to make sure we’re not creating too many different pages because this could slow down the loading process.","Python is much more structured than PHP.  If I remember correctly, each line of code has to be indented correctly or else the script won't run properly.

Since PHP is more widely used, I would imagine it has better libraries and wider support.  I've used PHP extensively and I can tell you it has more features than any other scripting language I've used.",1,"The python is better than php. 
On the one hand:
1) discounting those differences, I found that python was orders of magnitude easier, briefer to code, and got the job done faster than curl working concurrently (on windows/apache2, mind you) because curl and php has weird issues, even when running php as fastcgi . 
2) I'm not sure the exact reason for python to be faster than PHP, but I would bet its because of Google's influence with Python. 
3) That's irrelevant because what made PHP successful is not what PHP is lacking but the features that PHP has that are superior to Python.

2) I know that serving a python base webpage via cgi is slower than php because of its long start up every time.",1," I think it depends on what you are trying to do. If your goal is just to write a simple application that displays some text and display the results in an HTML page, then PHP might be more suitable. But if you want something more, like writing a complex application, or even building one from scratch, then JavaScript would probably be better. In fact, there are many other languages out there, but they all have their own strengths and weaknesses. For example, Ruby has great support for object-oriented programming, which makes it very useful as well.",,"  PHP has a lot of features that are not available in Python. For example, you can use the same syntax to write code in Python as it does in PHP. You also have access to many more libraries and frameworks such as Django, Express, etc. In addition, there are several other languages like Ruby or Scala which offer similar features.The main advantage of using PHP over Python lies on its type system."
44,ds,ps3,,"Which seventh generation video game system (Wii, XBOX 360, Nintendo DS, PSP, PS3) will be best?"," The Wii U is the best of all seven generations. It has a better graphics engine, faster loading times, and more powerful hardware. However, it lacks online multiplayer, which makes its gameplay less fun than that on other consoles. If you want to play online, then get an Xbox 360 or PS3 instead. What are your favorite games from each generation? Why? I love playing Super Smash Bros. Melee. It’s one of my most played games. Also, Final Fantasy VII was very good. Other popular titles include Mario Kart 8, Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag, Grand Theft Auto IV, Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes, Saints Row IV and more. Do you have any advice for new gamers? Don’t buy too many games, especially if they aren’t new. You can easily spend hundreds of dollars in just two months buying used games. Instead, wait until they’re cheaper and go with that. Also don’t forget about saving money. Buying used games means you’ll save money over purchasing new, so it’s worth it."," I have a feeling that the answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If you want an easy way to play your games with friends and family, then DS has it covered. But if you prefer playing them alone or in small groups, PSP does not. The only other option for those who do not like online gaming would be PSP. However, there will always be people out there who enjoy offline gaming. So while both systems offer different features, they also share some of their same problems. For example, DS’s screen resolution may seem higher but its color palette is much more limited compared to PSP’s. Also, because of the smaller screen, the system can get very hot when using it. This means that many gamers end up buying portable consoles instead. What about games? There are plenty of great titles available for DS. Most of these games were developed by Nintendo.","PS3 is better than DS.
Sony is going to disappoint it's fans again.  Isn't it about time that all the Sony fanboys realized that it is time to get off the bandwagon?  I mean look at the PSP.  Technologly superior to the DS, but overpriced and crappy software support. I am not planning to buy a PS3 for a couple of reasons.  Price.  Who in their right mind is going to pay 600 for a video console.
Seeing that it cost Nintendo $100 (at most) to manufacture the 3DS last feb and could have made further deals with the retailers and suppliers to bring cost/risk down.  In any case, the Vita being a lot more advanced should be selling at a loss also if that is the situation.  ( my opinion) .  3DS reached 5 milliononly marginally slower then the DS, and like you said, it released in Spring, not Fall like the other consoles.","The ps3 is better than ds. 
On the one hand:
1) Nowadays few reasonable people argue that the PS3 has the best library, and PSP has great games (better than the DS imo). 
2) The PSP is superior in EVERY concievable way to the DS. 
3) While you may argue PS3 is going to be the best or PSP is better then DS, or whatever floats your boat, the one thing you can't argue with is that PC gaming is dying. 

On the other hand: 
1) Sonic Colors for DS and Wii sold better than Sonic Generations on 360, PS3, and PC combined. 
2) If you're talking about disc space issues, there are DS RPGs that are better than most PS3 RPGs. 
3) The new DS controller is 100 times better than the PS3's version. 
","The ps3 is better than ds.

2) - More compact (2/3 as large) and lighter (20% lighter) than the original DS Lite. 
3) In the same way, I found GTA4's even better than DS's (although admittably the pacing was superior in DS).

But now that they are out on both consoles i think it’s time to move on. The games look great but there isn’t much new here. And as for multiplayer, well you can just play with your friends online which is fine if that’s what you’re into. If not then there really isnt anything worth buying in this game. @rjejr – You don’t need an Xbox One to enjoy these games. They run perfectly fine on my PC (Intel i7 4790K @ 4.5GHz) without any issues. I’ve played them all at least once and enjoyed every one. As far as I’m concerned, they’re all great. This game looks amazing so far. Can’t wait to see how it plays when we get our hands on it. Also can’t believe no one has mentioned the fact that the game will be available digitally through XBLA via Backward Compatibility."," and Xbox 360 The PlayStation 4 is the most powerful console ever made. It has a whopping four times more processing power than its predecessor, which means it can do things like play games at 4K resolution without any noticeable slowdown. And thanks to an updated version of the PS4's operating system, it's even faster - with new features such as cloud saves for game saves. But what about those pesky performance issues? We put them to the test by playing some of our favourite titles on both consoles in order to see how they stack up. In terms of raw power, the PS3 outperforms the PS4, but that's not really saying much. Both systems are capable enough that you could easily run two or three full HD movies simultaneously if you're running your system at 1080p resolution. However, there were several occasions where we noticed significant differences between the two, particularly when using certain games. For example, Far Cry Primal was noticeably slower on the PS3, while Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag ran just fine on the Xbox."," and Xbox 360 The PS4 is a great console but the games are not as good as they could be. I have played all of my PS3 games, including Uncharted 4, on both consoles so it isn’t like I’m missing out on anything. If you want to play your favorite game then get an Xbox, if not, go with the PS4. The only thing that really matters for me in gaming right now is how much fun do I have. And this system has been very fun. It does everything I need from it. So far I’ve had no problems at all. This review was written by Alex R.

It has been in storage for about 20 years now. The only thing that looks like it’s original to me are some rust stains on the trunk lid. Other than that, everything else seems original. My dad bought this car from an insurance company back when he had his own auto repair business. He sold it at auction after we moved out but never got around to selling it. When I saw it, I knew immediately what it was. It’s just so cool. I’ve always wanted one. I’m not sure if they still make them though. They were made before all those safety features came into play. This is awesome! I love seeing how many people know who owned their cars. And then you can see where they lived. Great job with the photos!! I am very interested in knowing more about the history of the car. What year did it come out? Where did it go to? Did anyone drive it? How long ago did it get sold?"," The answer to that question depends on your definition of better. Chevrolet’s new Colorado has a lot going for it, but it’s not quite as good or even close to the best car in its class. That distinction belongs to the Ford F-150 Raptor, which was recently named Best Truck by Consumer Reports. It’s also much more expensive at $49,900. But it offers plenty of features and performance upgrades over the Colorado’s standard equipment. It comes with an eight-speed automatic transmission, a heated steering wheel, power windows, air bags, cruise control, satellite radio, a backup camera, a DVD player, a navigation system, leather seats, a CD player and more. And if you want something that’s just slightly better, there’s always the Chevy Silverado 1500, which starts at about $36,000. How do these two cars compare? Let’s start with price. Both are based on GM’s current full-size pickup truck, the GMC Sierra 1500. They both have a base price starting around $30,000, though the Ram 1500 goes up from there.","Ford is better than Chevrolet.
We've got some real numbers for the all new 2013 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 powered by a 5.8L Supercharged V8 rated a 662 horsepower.  5.0 Mustang and Super Fords put one on a DynoJet where it put down 609 horsepower and 609 ft-lbs of torque at the rear wheels.  There were also some drag strip runs done where the new GT500 was running 11.6 @ 125 MPH , which is much quicker and faster than any of it's nearest competitors, the Chevrolet Camaro ZL1  and Dodge Challenger SRT8 492 .

If you’re a daily driver, then Ford and Chevy are both great choices. But if your commute involves long trips in heavy traffic, then you’ll want something else. For example, I drive an Infiniti G35 sedan that gets about 40 miles per gallon (mpg) with regular unleaded gas. That means my gas bill will be $220 more than it would have been had I bought a comparable vehicle from Chevy. And that’s assuming no other factors affect my driving habits. In addition to fuel economy, there are also environmental considerations. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the average American drives roughly 20 million miles each year. That’s enough mileage for one person to travel around the world four times. So even though it’s not as environmentally friendly as buying a new car, owning a hybrid can help reduce our carbon footprint. Hybrids aren’t just good for reducing emissions — they’re good for saving money."," and the other is a Toyota vs. Honda. The only thing that makes me think of this as an actual race is how close it is. I don’t know if it’s because I’m not familiar with any of these cars or what but they all look pretty much identical to me. It’s like they’re just trying to get in front of each other. That’s why you see so many people on track at once. They are trying to make sure everyone else doesn’t catch up before them. It looks really cool when someone does that. Advertisement And then there’s the fact that, for some reason, there seems to be more than one car per lane. This means that every time somebody passes another car, he has to wait until he’s out of his lane before passing. That can take quite a while. So even though it’s technically two cars, you’re still waiting for them to pass you. You have to keep your eyes peeled for cars. If you don’t, you’ll end up getting passed by everyone. But that’s okay. Because those guys aren’t going anywhere."," and the rest of the auto industry is a joke. I think that if you look at it from an economic point of view, GM has been doing very well for quite some time now. They are still making money on their cars even though they have to sell them in order to pay back all those loans. The reason why people like me don’t buy new vehicles anymore is because we know how much more expensive these things are. If you want something new, go with a used car. You can get one cheaper than buying new. And that’s what I’m doing. My wife doesn’t care about my car being brand new or not. She just wants it to be reliable. So when she sees this car, she’s happy. When I see it, it’s not so great. But then again, neither am I. It’s nice knowing that you’re saving money. That’s what’s important.

46,nikon,sigma,70-300mm lens,"I`m planning to buy 70-300mm lens. Which is a better choice: nikon , sigma or tamaron?"," Hi David, I have the same question as you. The answer depends on your needs. If you are shooting in low light and need fast AF, then go for Nikon. But if you want something that can be used with any lens from 35mm all the way up to 400mm, then Tamaron/Tamron will do just fine. You could also try Sigma but they don’t make lenses like Nikon does. They only offer adapters so it would not work well with most lenses. For example, my Canon EF 100mm f/2.8 Macro works great with this lens, but when I use it with my other lenses, such as my Canon 50mm f/1.8 L, it doesn’t work. So check out their website before buying an adapter for it. Thanks for sharing your experience David. It was very helpful for me. I’m new to photography and am trying to decide between two different brands of lenses. One has been around since the early 90s and the other one is brand new. My main concern is how much difference there is. Would you recommend going with Sigma?"," I have a D7100 and am looking at the new 50mm f/1.4. The reviews are good but there seems to be some confusion about whether it will work with my camera or not. Is this lens compatible with all of my cameras? If so, which one? Thanks in advance. Hi Roger, thanks for your reply. I’m not sure what you mean by “compatible”. It depends on how many lenses you have. For example, if you own two lenses, one that has an aperture ring (manual focus) and another that does not, then yes, they can both work. However, if you only own one, then no, because it’s not possible to use them together. You would need to buy a different lens. But that’s just a matter of personal preference. 🙂 Thank you, Roger. I’ve been using the 50 1.8 since day one. It’s so sharp and fast compared to any other prime out there. And now I know why people say it takes great pictures. My copy was made back when Canon still had their old primes.","Sigma is better for Nikon for lens.
This is no worse than with the Nikon 18-70 DX, but will leave those with the need for faster apertures slightly disappointed (in truth they would be better served by a constant aperture lens). Tack sharp, extended focal range . The Sigma 17-70 shares the same characteristics as the 18-50/2.8: it is sharp at all apertures at the center, then decreases in sharpness in the corners.  Focusing a bit loud .
 There are those that believe that Nikon and Canon lenses are superior to 3rd party (e.g. Sigma, Tamron, Tokina) lens manufacturers, period. There are those that believe that some lenses from 3rd party manufacturers are as good as the big boys. ","The sigma is better than nikon. 
On the one hand:
1) BTW, I bought the Sigma 50 1.4 about 3 years ago, because it was better than the Nikon and only $100 more. 
2) The sigma is much faster focusing and better then the Nikon 1.4 g in the center at all of the low apertures. 
3) The images are far better than a couple of Nikon lenses I have. 

On the other hand: 
1) I recently purchased the Nikon 55-200 4-5.6G and can truly say the Nikon delivers substantially better image quality than the Sigma. 
2) The only difference I saw between them was the focus speed of Nikon is slightly better than the Sigma. 
3) The Nikon 8mm is one of Nikon's legendary lenses, far superior over the Sigma 8mm.","The sigma is better than nikon. 
On the one hand: 
1) It definitely focuses faster and works better than a nikon G in low light conditions. 
2) The Sigma has faster autofocus but the Tamron had even better IQ than the Nikon 18-200, what a dilemma . 
3) If they can make it better than there 60mm (which I bought, as it was FAR superior to the nikon macros I tried) it will be well worth the price, and maybe even better than the nikon 105mm .

On the other hand:
1) The Nikon AF-S 80-400mm is slightly lighter and of course better appointed than the Sigma's, although the Sigma was no slouch. 
2) Nikon 10-24 is more useful, better built, faster to focus, easer to manually override AF if needed, sharper and therefore better than Sigma 10-20. 
3) Canon isn't much better, though: They pump out new APS-C bodies faster than most people change their underwear - but their EF-S lenses are completely incompatible with their FF bodies (they don't have a crop mode like Nikon).","I would prefer to use sigma because it's faster, price and cheaper. But you should know that nikon is lighter, faster to focus and faster.","I came to the conclusion that sigma is better, because it's older and cheaper. But it will be useful for you to know that nikon is faster to focus and longer."," I have a D800 and an A7RII. The A7 has the best IQ of any camera I’ve ever used. It also shoots at higher ISOs than my D800/Canon 5D Mk II combo which makes it possible to shoot in lower light without using flash. This means that you can use your flash if necessary. But the A7s does not support remote shutter release so you need to be very close to the camera. And yes, this will make shooting with AF difficult. You may want to consider getting a mirrorless body like the Sony a6300 instead. @jdmc – I’m sure there are many other factors as well. For example, what kind of lens do you use? Do you own Nikkor lenses? If so, then you’ll probably find that they perform better on the A7. Also, how much time did you spend testing each camera? Did you compare them side by side? Are you familiar enough with cameras to know whether one performs better than another?"," and Sony vs Canon. I have a D7100 with the 18-105 lens that is great for travel but not so good at indoor low light situations. The 24-70 f/2.8 would be perfect in this situation. It has been my experience that if you can get your hands on one of these lenses it will perform better than any other zoom lens. This was true even when compared to the 70-200 f/2.8. If you are looking for an all around lens, especially for travel, then go no further than this. You won’t find another lens like it. As far as image quality, there isn’t much to say about this one. It’s really hard to beat the sharpness from such a small lens. However, it’s also very soft wide open which makes me wonder how well it performs in lower light. I’m sure I’ll figure out what works best once I’ve used it more. But right now I’d give it a thumbs up because of its sharpness."," for the same price and I would go with Sigma. The only thing that is missing from this review is a comparison of the two lenses in low light. If you are shooting at f/1.4 or faster then it will be very difficult to tell if there is any difference between them. This lens has been around since 2009 so they should have had some time to work out all these issues. But as far as sharpness goes it seems like an excellent lens. It does not seem to suffer much distortion even wide open. And when stopped down to f/5.6 it really shines compared to my other lenses. So unless your looking for something sharper than this, get it.

The new lens is a great addition to the lineup and will be available in late September for $499.99. It features an f/1.8 aperture with a maximum magnification of 0.99x, which makes it ideal for shooting sports at low light levels. This allows you to shoot fast moving subjects without having to use flash indoors. Additionally, this lens has been optimized for autofocus performance so that your camera can focus on any subject while keeping its shutter open. If you’re looking for something more than just a basic zoom lens, then you’ll want to check out Nikon’s latest offering. It’s called AF-S NIKKOR 18-35mm F3.5-5.6G ED VR (Model # DX-VARIO-18MF). With a focal length range from 28mm all the way up to 400mm, it’s perfect for capturing those special moments when you need to get closer to your subject. And if that’s not enough, the lens also includes vibration reduction technology that reduces unwanted vibrations during video recording.","I have used Sigma lenses with Nikon SLRs and found them excellent for quality and better value than Nikon manufactured lenses. My last Sigma 28-80mm lens was bought secondhand from Jessops. It has a very good macro facility and has performed faultlessly for an outlay of well under half  the price of a new Nikkor lens.
I have a Sigma 70-200mm lens bought new that has also been excellent but I did find that the Nikkor 70-300 lens I tested beforehand was difficult to use handheld without camera shake problems, i.e. needed a tripod! Also with the digital SLR 1.5x magnification factor for focal length, such problems would be much greater.

On the one hand:
1) the sigma better be damn good since the nikon 85 AF-S is said to be better than the 85/1.4 D, which is legendary.

3) The Sigma and Tamron are superior to the Nikon, because . 
4) But only if it's significantly better then the Nikon AF-S 85mm f/1.8G, because for the price that lens is a killer. 
5) In summary, if you are looking for a stabilized luminous lens kit at a lower cost, either the Tamron or the slightly-superior Sigma will work well - especially since both lenses deliver better image quality than the more expensive Canon or Nikon 17-55mm.

On the other hand: 
1) I still think the Nikon is going to be a better buy than the Sigma lens because Nikon lenses tend to be (in my experience) a bit more mechanically rugged and durable than brands like Sigma, Tamron, Tokina, etc. . 
2) The Nikon is very sharp and really better as a walk around lens than the Sigma because of the weight factor and the Nikon has the rubber seal on the camera mount for better weather sealing. 
3) apparently because Sigma and Zeiss can't design and build better cameras than Nikon, Canon, or Pentax.",,,,
47,mysql,oracle,,"What can you do with Oracle that would be difficult to do with PostgreSQL, or MySQL?"," The answer is a lot. You have the ability to create your own custom database engine and use it in any application where SQL Server isn't available. This means you could build an entire web site using only one database, instead of building multiple databases for each application. It also allows you to easily share data between applications without having to worry about whether it's going over a network connection or not. If you're looking at this from a technical perspective, then yes, there are some advantages to Oracle.

If your goal is to build a database that can be used for many different purposes, then yes, it may well be better. However, if you want to use MySQL as an application server, then no, it’s not going to work very well. The reason being that, while mysql’s syntax and semantics make it easy to write applications with it, its performance characteristics don’t quite match those of other databases. For example, in my experience, when using MySQL, there tends to be more overhead associated with writing queries compared to other databases such as Postgres, Cassandra or MongoDB. This means that even though mysql has some advantages over these databases, they still have their place. In addition, since MySQL doesn’t require any special configuration from you, it makes building complex web apps much easier. Finally, because most people who will read this blog probably already know about MySQL’s strengths and weaknesses, I’ll just mention them here.","Oracle is better than mysql.
Ability to convert depends completely on the application.  If the MySQL app written using simple or at least standard SQL, it will be easy to migrate.  Converting from PostgreSQL to Oracle has always seemed much easier and smoother, but PostgreSQL isn't as popular as MySQL because it hasn't been as easy to throw hardware at problems with scaling PostgreSQL, whereas MySQL has always made that option easier.

It was easy to get started with and it feels very stable in terms of performance. The only thing missing from my opinion are some more advanced features like integration with other systems such as MySQL. But this is not a big deal since most people will use their own custom database anyway. If you want to learn about how to set up your first database, check out these two great tutorials by David Heinemeier Hansson on his blog. He also wrote an excellent book called “Database Design” which covers all aspects of building databases including setting them up. You can find David’s blog post here if you’re interested in reading more. Conclusion In conclusion, there really isn’t much difference between using either one of them. Both offer good performance at low cost but they both come with different features. For me, choosing one over another depends mostly on what kind of data I’m working with."," The first thing to understand is that the two most popular databases in use today are MySQL and Oracle. Both of these database systems have been around for a long time, but they both started out as open source projects. As such, there was no need for them to be proprietary. However, since Oracle’s acquisition by Sun Microsystems it has become clear that their business model does not work well with open source. This means that they will either have to change or die. In order to do this, they must find another way to make money from their customers. They can choose one of three options: 1. Open Source – this option allows you to continue using your existing software while also giving others access to it. You still get all the benefits of an open source, proprietary product without having to pay any licensing fees.2. Proprietary – this option requires you to buy into a subscription plan which gives you access to only certain features. It may cost more than buying the same features on a free basis."," The first thing to understand about the two is that they are both open source projects and have been for a long time. This means that you can use them in any environment where there is an Internet connection. You don’t need to be running on your own server or even using their cloud service. If you’re not familiar with these technologies, then I recommend reading this article by Scott Hanselman from last year. It will give you some insight into how they’re used today. In addition, each has its strengths and weaknesses. For example, MySQL was designed as a database engine which could run anywhere – it doesn’t matter if it’s at home or in a data center. However, Oracle’s databases were built specifically for large scale deployments of applications. They also offer more features than MySQL. So, what does all this mean? Well, when choosing between one database, choose whichever one best suits your needs. There isn’t really much difference between them. Both provide great performance but different features. Which Database Should You Choose?"," and theother two are open source projects that have been developed by their respective developers. The project is still in its early stages of development but it has already gained a lot of attention from both developers as well as customers.

""Nobody ever got fired for recommending IBM."".

I guess you could change that to ""Oracle"" nowadays.  Considering the high cost of Oracle (compared to MySQL), a little extra work makes sense.

If you visit mysql.com, you'll see that major players like eVite, Yahoo!, Weather Channel, Ticketmaster, NASA, Google, Suzuki, Dell, Nokia, UPS, etc. all use MySQL internally.  I'm sure MySQL isn't the ONLY database software they use, but there are obviously some BIG companies that are seeing the merits of MySQL.

The Oracle crowd will tell you that Oracle is better, but don't believe it.  And IF there are things that Oracle can do that MySQL doesn't, so what!   Do you really need that handful of features?

It was the first handheld to have 3D capabilities, and it sold over 13 million units worldwide.

I think that this is because they can play games like Super Mario 3D Land or New Super Luigi U, which were released on other systems. This means that if you want to play those games, you’ll need an older system. If you’re looking for something more modern, then check out the Nintendo Switch. It’s also worth noting that while both systems offer great gaming experiences, some gamers may find them lacking when compared with Nintendo’s previous consoles.

Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate – While the original Monster Hunter, released back in 2012, was already quite impressive, Monster Hunter: World takes things up another notch. It features all sorts of new features, including online multiplayer, cooperative play, and more. If you’re looking for something different but equally as fun, then look no further. 3."," U games on the eShop. Nintendo has also announced that it will be releasing a new version of Super Mario Bros. U, which is scheduled to launch in North America and Europe this fall. The game was first released for the 3DS last year, but now it's coming out as part of Nintendo's latest hardware redesign. This isn't the only major announcement from Nintendo.

If you’re looking for a truck with the best towing capacity, then you’ll probably choose the Chevy Silverado. But if you’d rather have more power than tow capability, then go with the Toyota. And while it’s true that both trucks are great at hauling large loads, they also offer different levels of performance when it comes to driving style. For example, the Tacoma has an aggressive look that’s perfect for off-road driving, but its handling isn’t as good off road. On the other hand, the GMC Sierra offers a sportier feel that makes it ideal for city driving. In fact, many people prefer one over the other. So which do you prefer?http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/28/science/earth/in-arctic-ice-melting-faster-than-expected.html?_r=0Melting Is Accelerating Faster Than Expected Off Arctic Coast A new study shows melting along Alaska’s coast faster than expected, raising concerns about how quickly ice sheets will respond to rising temperatures."," The answer to that question depends on what you consider “quality.” If you’re looking at the truck as a daily driver, then yes, it is. But if you’re considering buying one because of its off-road capabilities, it’s not quite there. It’s also much more expensive and less reliable than other trucks. And while there are some good things about it, like being able to tow an extra trailer or carry four people in the bed, there’s no denying that this particular model has been around since before I was born. So how does Toyota’s new Tacoma compare with trucks from Ford, Ram 1500, and even General Motors? Let’s take a look at each one. Ford F-150 Raptor vs. Chevy Silverado 1500 As far as overall quality goes, both trucks have their pluses. Both can haul up to 80,000 pounds without any problems. They come standard with either 5.7-liter V8 engines or 6.2-liter V8s. In fact, they all use the same engine. This means that they’re pretty similar when it comes to towing capacity.
","Chevrolet Silverado is better than Toyota Tundra for quality, power, fuel economy.
Comfort Passengers in the extended cab will be able to stretch out a lot more with the Toyota Tundra than the Chevrolet Silverado 1500.  The Chevrolet Silverado 1500 will be a favorite with tall drivers and their passengers since it has much greater head- and legroom than the Toyota Tundra. Convenience With the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 you will definitely be making fewer stops at the gas station than with the Toyota Tundra, due to its tank size and fuel economy.

","After much thought, I realized that  chevrolet is better, because it's faster, legroom and easier. But i should tell you that toyota is quicker, easier to win over and easier.","Looks like chevrolet is better, because it's  and higher. Toyota is larger, quicker and easier to access."," I have a 2005 Toyota Camry and it has the same engine as my 2006 Chevy Impala. The only difference between them is that one of them uses an automatic transmission. My car was built in Japan while mine was made in Mexico. Both cars are running great. They both get about 30 mpg combined. So what makes the Japanese make such great cars? It all comes down to their manufacturing process. If you look at most other countries, they use much cheaper labor than we do. This means less profit per unit produced. In addition, if your product costs more to produce, then people will buy less. That leads us back to our original question. Why do so many Americans think foreign cars are superior to American cars. Well, because there aren't any good ones out there. There isn't even a decent one. And that's why we're losing ground on this issue. We need to start making some quality products here again. But until then, we'll just keep buying cheap Chinese junk."," and reliability. The new model will be available in the US starting this summer. It is expected to go on sale in Europe next year. In a statement, GM said it was ""pleased with our performance in meeting our goal of producing more than 500,000 vehicles by 2025"". Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage captionGeneral Motors has been struggling as sales have fallen off sharply since last year But analysts say that while there are signs of improvement - including lower production costs at its main European assembly plant - overall demand remains weak. ""The market share battle between Chevy and Ford appears to be over,"" said analyst Akshay Anand. He added that GM's rivals were also facing challenges from cheaper Chinese imports which had led them to cut back their own output. Mr Anand said: ""While we believe that the current weakness in the global auto industry may not last, we do expect some recovery over coming years due to strong growth potential in China and other emerging markets."""," The battle for the hearts and minds of American drivers is heating up. And it’s not just in the United States. In Europe, where there are more than 50 million cars on the road, there’s a growing trend to switch from one brand to another. This year, Volkswagen will launch its new Passat model with an all-electric powertrain. Meanwhile, BMW plans to introduce two electric models next year. Audi has announced that it will build a plug-in hybrid version of its A3 sedan. Mercedes-Benz recently unveiled its first EV model, which goes into production this summer. But while these brands have been making big moves toward electrification, they haven’t all gone completely electric. Some automakers still use internal combustion engines as their primary means of propulsion. Ford Motor Company uses diesel engines, but also offers hybrids powered by natural gas. General Motors sells both gasoline and diesel. So does Volkswagen, whose latest diesel-engined car was introduced last month. GM says its Volt plug-in hybrid, which went on sale late last month, can go up to 100 miles per charge without using any gasoline."," and reliability. The new Camaro is a true American car that will be built in the United States by Americans with American jobs. It has been designed to meet our nation’s environmental standards while delivering performance on every level. This means it meets all of the current federal emissions standards, including those set forth under CAFE. And because it’s made here at Chevrolet, we can count on its reliability and quality. We are proud to announce today that General Motors will build the all-new 2017 Chevrolet Camaro. Our partnership with GM represents an important step forward as both companies work together toward creating jobs right here in America. As part of this partnership, we’ll also invest more than $1 billion into U.S. manufacturing facilities over the next five years. Together, these investments create thousands of high-paying jobs, help support local communities, and strengthen America’s position as one of the most innovative countries in the world. In addition to building the all-new Camaro, we’re working hard to make sure customers have access to great products like the 2018 Corvette Stingray and upcoming F-150 Raptor.","The Chevy is better, already is proven to get 20+mpg, highly improved interior and overall quality, BIGGER ENGINE, and better looking. Last year Toyota had the most recalls, but the media ""failed"" to notice since millions would stand against them because of thier reputation. These days reputation is nothing, technology advances so fast it cant keep up. For ex: three years ago GM was one of the worst companies, now they have the most top-rated vehicles, and the quality/reliability surpasses Toyota. Honda is still on top of the reliability ratings. Ford also had more recalls than GM and DaimlerChrysler combined, for reasons like exploding engines and wheels falling off. Here is a quote from the Washington Posts review of the Toyota CAmry ""one of which is the Chevrolet Malibu, which in my real-world driving experience has been every bit as good and reliable as the much-ballyhooed Camry but has been maligned primarily because it is a Chevrolet"". Oddly enough that was an '04 Malibu VS the totally redisigned '07 Camry. Tim magazine also said ""GM has made huge leaps in quality"". Common problems with Toyotas are plastic rattling until it falls off. People then complain that when they take it to the dealer to be fixed they just say ""The cars are made with so much plastic its practically impossible to fix"" GM is also the worlds fastest growing manufacturer, and that dosent happen by accident.",1,,1," The answer to this question depends on the type of driving you do. If you're a daily driver, then yes, it's more important for your truck to be fuel-efficient. But if you're an occasional driver who drives less than 10,000 miles per year, then it may not matter as much. In that case, you'll want something with higher mileage. And that's where trucks like the Chevy Colorado come in. For those looking at buying their first truck, here's what makes them so appealing.",, I have a 2006 corolla and the car has been in my family since 2006. It was bought new from an auto parts store with no warranty. The engine started to run rough after about 2 years of use. My mechanic said that it would cost me around $2000 dollars just to fix it. He also told me that he doesn’t know how long this will last because it’s not made like other cars out there. So I’m wondering if there are any good options for a used corolla. Thanks guys.
50,bmw,honda,,Would it be better to buy a new Honda civic or a 2000 bmw 323?,"ANSWER: I would recommend the latter because of its lower price and higher mpg. You can find out more about how much fuel you use in your car by going to this website: http://fuelprices.net which shows what kind of gas is used for different makes and models. From there, you can compare prices at various stations around you. Another thing that people often do when they are deciding on an automobile is look up their driving habits so that they know if it’s worth buying new. The best way to determine whether something is worthwhile to purchase new, especially with regard to a vehicle, is to see how many miles you’ve put on it. If you’re not satisfied after only 1,000 miles, then perhaps there isn’t enough mileage left in the tank to justify purchasing a brand-new vehicle. In order to get rid of old cars, you have to go through several steps before selling them. First, you’ll need to take them off the road. Next, you’ll want to sell them, but that’s where things start getting complicated."," I think Honda has a very good engine and they have done an excellent job with the engine. But BMW are doing something that no other manufacturer can do. They have made their engines so much better. And now we see what happens when you make your engine even more powerful. It makes it easier to get away from the fuel economy of the old engines. So if Mercedes were to do that, then maybe there would be some kind of competition between them. But at this stage in time, it’s not going to happen. The only way for them to compete is by making their cars better, which means using new technologies. That’s why I’m convinced that BMW’s next car will use electric motors. Because that’s where the future lies. What about Mercedes? It’s hard to say. You can’t really compare one company against another. There are many things happening in Formula 1 right now. We don’t know what’s going on behind closed doors. If Mercedes had been able to develop its own engine, then perhaps they could have won. But as far as we’re concerned, they’re still behind.","Honda Civic is better than BMW.
I knew that BMW had a good reputation of being the Ultimate Driving Machine.  I just assumed that the manual tranny would be a dream to operate.  How my dream was since crushed.  I soon learned that a Honda Civic shifts smoother than my BMW. 
 It is like quantify why BMW 335is is a better can than a Honda Civic Si. For me. They both will get the job done.  In summary, the arrow performance has not been the weak link - for me.  For those who wanted more and know what they wanted, needed, and able to squeeze more, I offer them the ultimate shooting experience.","Honda is better than bmw. 
On the one hand:
1) it is probably the best roadster on the market - far better than the bmw z3 in my opinion and much better looking. 
2) Not only Honda doesn't have better reliability -although they have better dealer service than BMW-, but the handling, the great driving and all the technology that Mercedes and BMW have, Honda just doesn't has it. 
3) Some claim that a Honda grease for coating the shaft splines is better than that used by BMW. 

On the other hand: 
1) Maybe, by operating the motorcycles, one notes the weight more contained of BMW, 50 kg lighter than the Honda, but of which the higher center of gravity requires finally more attention than envisaged. 
2) Since Honda Accords aren't generally considered performance cars, those specs are harder to find than the same numbers for a Nissan or BMW, rickando. 
3) I was on a much better equipped off-road motorcycle than the BMW R100, now using a Kawasaki KLR650 , far superior in the gravel and mud I remembered falling down on and in before the Honda cowboy and I parted ways. 
","Honda is better than bmw. 
On the one hand: 
1) Better and lighter than any car i've driven BMW included. 
2) On the other hand, they write that the Honda is easier to ride, more maneuverable, more comfortable, and carries its weight better than the BMW. 
3) That's as quick as a V6 Honda Accord, which is FWD (which means it's lighter) and has 240 horsepower, quicker than a FWD Toyota Camry V6 and very near the 0-60 times of the six-cylinder BMW 330Xi and G35X.

On the other hand:
1) BMW is a nicer car, handles better, has more prestige...but will never cost less to maintain than a Honda... . 
2) It's no BMW ( BMW:GR ), but the CT 200h offers a nicer cabin and greater driving panache than high-mileage competitors such as the Prius and Honda ( HMC ) Insight .

We are very happy with our performance so far this year. I think that we have improved as well as last year because of some new parts which we had been working on during the winter. The car has also become more stable over the winter when compared to previous years. It feels like it’s getting better every time you drive it.

I’m really excited by what will be coming up for us here in Bahrain. This weekend marks another step towards achieving our goal of becoming world champions again. There is no doubt that if we can do that, then we should go back home happy."," and the other is a BMW vs Toyota with a bit of an edge to it. I think that you are right in saying that there will be some sort of compromise between the two manufacturers but it won’t be as drastic as what has been proposed so far. The only thing that would make me happy about this situation is if they were able to get rid of the engine bay doors on both cars which have always bothered me. It seems like such a waste for something that should just go away. @rjejr – I’m not sure how much weight you put into your “compromise” comment. If anything, it’s more likely than not. As far as the engines go, I’d say they’re pretty similar at least from my experience driving BMWs. But again, that’s probably because I’ve driven them all over Europe many times before. So maybe there’s still room for improvement. A lot of people seem to forget that these are sports cars."," Civic and the other is a BMW 3 Series with an automatic transmission.
