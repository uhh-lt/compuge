travel.stackexchange,4213,Last minute flight bookings - better to book online or at the airport?,I might contribute some inside knowledge since I am working for a company which contributed the software for a major cheap-flight company.   Generally the prices are determined by offer and the demand BUT there is another major variable (in fact several) in the game for short-booking. Statistics show that most (80%) last-minute bookers are in an important need for the short booking and therefore willing to pay more. So the function which generates the price for short-bookings is not a complete function of offer and demand any more like it was years ago.  If you want to know what's the deal do the following: Go to your online bookers homepage. Search for a flight which is taking off today and try to book that ticket. With this you firstly know how short you can book online and secondly if the prices are acceptable for you.   Your question is also highly location dependant. In the country I live (Switzerland) I get the cheapest flights through a friend who works at the airport and calls me when a certain flight is available. I can only recommend trying both the online and physical approach.  ,1,Neutral,2,online,"[[626, 632], [771, 782], [1072, 1082]]",at the airport,"[[1087, 1104]]"
music.stackexchange,6852,Is it better to play the keyboard standing or sitting?,"It will always be easier to sit and operate pedals - the required uneven shift in weight from one foot to the other and holding it for extended periods can become quite tiring.  If your biggest concern is how it looks to the audience then yes, you'll probably have to put up with the discomfort and awkward stance of standing but there are a couple of things you can do to help:    Make sure the keyboard is set at a comfortable height (certainly don't leave it at sitting height!) and place the pedals relative to your playing position such that you don't have to lean excessively to operate them. If they're too far forward, you'll find yourself leaning backwards.  Use a bar stool or similar behind you to 'lean' against. That way, you can appear to be standing but you also have the support of a seat. Make sure it's sturdy and not on a slippery floor, else it may let you down when you come to rely on it!

cs.stackexchange,3209,What is the difference between a scripting language and a normal programming language?,"I think the difference has a lot more to do with the intended use of the language.  For example, Python is interpreted, and doesn't require compiling and linking, as is Prolog. I would classify both of these as programming languges.  Programming langauges are meant for writing software. They are designed to manage large projects. They can probably call programs, read files, etc., but might not be quite as good at that as a scripting language.  Scripting langauges aren't meant for large-scale software development. Their syntax, features, library, etc. are focused more around accomplishing small tasks quickly. This means they are sometimes more ""hackish"" than programming langauges, and might not have all of the same nice features. They're designed to make commonly performed tasks, like iterating through a bunch of files or performing sysadmin tasks, to be automated.  For example, Bash doesn't do arithmetic nicely, which would probably make writing large-scale software in it a nightmare.  As a kind of benchmark: I would never write a music player in perl, even though I probably could. Likewise, I would never try to use C++ to rename all the files in a given folder.  This line is becoming blurrier and blurrier. JavaScript, by definition a ""scripting"" langauge, is increasingly used to develop ""web apps"" which are more in the realm of software.

cs.stackexchange,48866,Item lookaheads versus dot lookaheads for $LR(k)$ with $k \gt 1$?,"I think you are mistaken, they are needed but the dot look-ahead there is so obvious that you have not paid attention to the fact it is used.  First, let's remark that there are three kinds of items:    those in which the dot is just before a non-terminal. They never participate in an ambiguous situation: when a non-terminal has been produced, it is shifted.  those in which the dot is at the end. They have the item look-ahead and the dot look-ahead which are equal (what may follow the dot is what may follow the produced non-terminal when the production is reduced as the dot is at the end of the item).  those in which the dot is just before a terminal.  They have the item look-ahead and the dot look-ahead which are different.  The item look-ahead is what may follow the non-terminal when the production is reduced, the dot look-ahead start by the terminal which follow the dot and continue with what can be generated after that terminal.    Now, with a look-ahead of 1 or less, the dot look-ahead is trivial: either it is the item look-ahead or the terminal which is just after the dot and that's what you are using to solve a conflict (or decide that there is no way with the limited look-ahead you have).  With a look-ahead of 2 or more, you have to compute the dot look-head or you may not know if you have to shift or to reduce as in the example provided by Grune and Jacobs:  $$\begin{array}{l}  S \rightarrow Aa \; | \; Bb \;| \;Cec \;|\; Ded \\  A \rightarrow qE \\  B \rightarrow qE \\  C \rightarrow q \\  D \rightarrow q \\  E \rightarrow e \\  \end{array}$$  which has the state:  $$\begin{array}{lcc}  &\textrm{item look-ahead}&\textrm{dot look-ahead}\\  A \rightarrow q \cdot E & a\#  & ea\\  B \rightarrow q \cdot E & b \# & eb\\  C \rightarrow q \cdot   & ec   & ec\\  D \rightarrow q \cdot   & ed   & ed\\  E \rightarrow \cdot e   & a \# & ea\\  E \rightarrow \cdot e   & b \# & eb\\  \end{array}$$  ",1,Neutral,2,Item lookaheads,"[[410, 429], [671, 690], [736, 755], [1031, 1050]]",dot lookaheads,"[[46, 64], [434, 452], [695, 713], [824, 842], [987, 1005], [1269, 1286]]"

music.stackexchange,14834,What is the difference between male head voice and falsetto?,"Falsetto and chest voice are different mechanisms.  Basically, falsetto stretches the vocal folds by lengthening the distance between their fixtures (the larynx mechanism is a rather complex contraption with various muscle groups changing the overall geometry).  Chest voice, however, also involves tightening the muscles at the base of the vocal folds themselves, so it changes the consistency of the folds, not ""just"" their length.  That makes it comparatively easy to achieve good closure but produces a number of harmonics.  The pure falsetto action, in contrast, leaves the muscles in the folds alone, leading to a rather pure tone (bad for distinguishing vowels, actually).  With practice, one can achieve good closure and a rich tone even with falsetto.  As this requires the ""falsetto configuration"" of the larynx to be close to complete, good closure works best in the high range.  Which means that the use of the full falsetto (rather than a more mixed head voice) works better for natural baritones or basses rather than the rare true tenor.  The larger larynx and larger involved forces make it advisable not to start too early with heavy training: the cartiledge forming the respective mechanism takes decades to fully harden (ossify) after mutation.

travel.stackexchange,5588,"Suitcases: hard or soft?  Canvas, polycarbonate or something else?","There is no one right answer for this. Either kind of suitcase could serve you well for this trip.  In my experience, the quality of the workmanship seems much more important than which type of sides your suitcase has in regards to its ability to protect its contents. You'll want strong sturdy zippers with big teeth that won't break easily, nice thick fabric that won't rip easily or sturdy solid sides that can handle impacts without breaking, sturdy pulls on the zippers, wheels that glide easily, handle that telescopes easily, etc. You can tell the quality fairly easily from a physical examination. Looking at a suitcase from a big box retailer vs. somewhere that carries name brands (Samsonite, Liz Taylor, Tommy Hilfiger, etc. etc.) you will notice a large difference in the quality of the materials, and generally, you get what you pay for, however if you have a store that specializes in one off and overstock merchandise from designer brands (sorry, don't know any of the names of places down under to suggest), sometimes you can get a better deal for the quality.  Certainly, there are other features to consider, like whether the suitcase has dividers and zippers to keep clothes separated or organized, or expansion zippers to add space for unexpected souvenirs.   Weight is definitely a consideration, the heavier the suitcase, the less weight left for luggage and the heavier it is lugging it up and down stairs to your lodging, etc. For that same reason, picking a size as large as needed but not larger is helpful too...if you only need a medium roller-bag, don't get a large one! Some suitcases are designed with lighter-weight materials than others. Depending on what you are carrying, if the suitcase is flimsier, you will lose less weight of baggage allowance, but the innards will be less protected. How much protection you need clearly varies considerably by what you pack and how you pack it. Many canvas-like rollerbags have stiff sides on 2-5 of the six sides, so you could pack your more delicate items nearer to the stiff sides, and put more clothes closer to the softer side for adequate protection.   The type of items you describe needing to transport, the protection provided by a regular rollerbag is probably sufficient, and you don't have the excess weight of a totally hard-sided luggage, and as you said, quite versatile! If you're anticipating transporting your scuba gear in this suitcase regularly, I'd probably pick differently because my primary considerations would be different.

cooking.stackexchange,2995,Stock vs Broth - What's the difference in usage?,"Classification and use of Stocks vs. Broth:  Broths are the result of cooking meat, not just bones. They're generally the result of preparing another item and usually not prepared specifically on their own. The juices poured off from a roasted turkey (after being degreased) would be considered broth.  Whole chickens being poached for another preparation would create broth.  Stocks are made from just the bones. They are prepared specifically for use in other recipes (sauces, soups, stews, rice, etc.)  Stocks are never salted in their preparation or the finished dish will most likely end up too salty due to reduction that will take place upon further cooking. Note that homemade stock will be often a bit more broth-like than restaurant/commercial stocks, since it's really hard to get all the meat off the bones.  Stocks are usually simmered for a very long time (4-6 hours for chicken & 8-12 for veal/beef) to extract maximum flavor and gelatin from the bones.  Broths aren't usually cooked nearly as long due to the fact that cooking the meat for extended periods (even chicken surrounded by the liquid) will result in tough, flavorless meat.  Consomme: a fortified and clarified stock.  The stock is fortified in flavor by the addition of a ""raft"" which is a combination of lean ground meat (appropriate to the type of stock being used) with brunoise (1/16 inch) mirepoix (carrots, onions, celery), and egg whites.  The raft mixture is stirred into the cold stock and as it gently heats, the proteins coagulate forming a ""raft"" on top of the stock.  A small hole is poked in the center (if one hasn't already formed) and as the stock bubbles through the hole it leaches back through the ground meat/egg white raft which filters out impurities to clarify the stock and fortify it with flavor.  Bouillon:  French word for broth.  Court Bouillon: sometimes called a ""short broth"".  A poaching liquid usually used for fish that is usually comprised of water,  acid (lemon juice, vinegar, wine), parsley stems, bay leaves, peppercorns, and some salt.  When to use Stock vs. Broth:  Use stock when a sauce is to be reduced significantly or when clarity of the final result is preferred.  Broths can be substituted for stock when the body of the liquid or clarity isn't important, and when the liquid will be thickened by addition of a starch.

They are terrible, confusing terms that should never have been introduced (see page 5 of Rethinking and reframing the Carnegie classification).  The idea was that ""research extensive"" means there's an extensive research program covering many areas at a high level, which ""research intensive"" means there's just a narrowly focused, intensive research program in certain areas.  Basically, extensive is supposed to be better than intensive.  Of course the problem is that this really isn't what they sound like.  For example, most people would say Harvard is a research intensive university, but in this classification it's not.  Because of massive confusion, the Carnegie classification was updated to use other terms, but the old terms still persist.  One reason is that some people just got used to them and found it hard to develop new habits; another is that every time the classification changes, some universities end up moving to a less prestigious category than they used to be in, so they have a strong incentive to describe themselves using the old terms.

softwareengineering.stackexchange,65116,Structured programming versus OO programming,"You might want to go look at this quick video blog.  The upshot is that the difference between structured programming and OO programming is a matter of what they take away from programming, not about what they add.  Software disciplines like Structured Programming and Object Oriented Programming are constraining, not enabling.  Here are some definitions.  Warning: you aren't going to like them.    Structured programming is discipline  imposed upon goto (direct transfer of  control)  OO programming is discipline imposed   upon pointers to functions (indirect   transfer of control)   Functional programming is discipline   imposed upon assignment.  The first is not too hard to understand.  Dijkstra found that it was impossible to create general proofs of correctness when goto was allowed in algorithms.  However if control structures were limited to sequence, selection, and iteration, then proofs of correctness were possible.  Of course we don't even try to prove things correct nowadays, but we do like the simplicity and elegance of structured programming.    It's a little harder to understand OO.  We often define OO as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.  What is lesser knows is that all three of these attributes are achievable, and frequently were achieved in C.  Indeed, C++ started as just a preprocessor that compiled down to C.  It's not actually hard to encapsulate in C.  Nor it is hard to build data structures that are subsets of each other, simulating inheritance.  Polymorphism, however, is a bit harder.  It requires pointers to functions which, in C, are difficult to manage well.  What languages like C++ gave us was discipline imposed upon those pointers to functions.  The C++ compiler built the vtables for us, and initialized the pointers within them according to a strict formalism.  So in a very real sense OO is simply discipline imposed upon indirect transfer of control i.e. pointers to functions.  Structured programming is about how not to use goto.  OO is about how not to use pointers to functions.  And functional programming too is all about what not to do.  In functional programming we do not assign variables except in the most stringently controlled cases.  So in the end, all these  Programming ""technologies"" are actually constraining disciplines rather than enabling technologies.  They tell us what not to do more than they tell us what to do.  And that means that software development has not grown over the last 40 years.  Rather, it has shrunk.  It is become ever more constrained as we have learned all the things we shouldn't do.    Learning what not to do is good; but here's the disturbing question: What new things have we learned to do?

Once the iron reaches 500F I will add the steak for about 3 minutes per side (for a med-rare) I would also suggest wiping the iron with a little oil first.   ,3,broiling,2,grilling,"[[121, 155]]",broiling,"[[159, 177], [505, 522]]"
softwareengineering.stackexchange,96383,Is onError handler better than exceptions?,"I agree with Paul Equis's answer that exceptions should be preferred, but with a caveat.  One major feature of exceptions is that they break control flow.  This is usually desirable, but if it isn't then some other pattern might be useful for augmenting the exception system.  For example, suppose you're writing a compiler.  Exceptions might not be the best choice here, because throwing an exception stops the compile process.  This means that only that first error would be reported.  If you want to keep reading the source code in order to try and find more errors (as the C# and VB compilers do), then some other system is needed for reporting errors to the outside world.  The easiest way to take care of that would be saving the exceptions to a collection and then returning it. However, using an OnError delegate might be worthwhile if you want to give the caller an opportunity to give advice on how to proceed after each error.  That sounds like an uncommon scenario to me, though.  If you're not asking the caller to really micro-manage error handling, then using some flags to specify error-handling behavior would be less fiddly to work with.

academia.stackexchange,72286,Which is more important to get into top CS PhD program: High GPA or industry R&D project experience?,"Neither.  Top CS PhD progams are looking for strong evidence of future potential as an independent researcher.  Everything else is secondary. Recommendation letters that speak directly to your research potential, in personal, technical, and credible detail, with direct comparisons with other students they have mentored who have gone on to strong PhD programs, will serve you far better than either a perfect GPA or industry internships or even both.  Strong research results are even better.  A better way to way to ask this question is...    Which is more important for finding a strong, supportive mentor and a fruitful topic for undergraduate research: high GPA or industry internships?    But even this is missing the mark. It's not your GPA that you want to maximize, but rather (1) your mastery of the material, and (2) your interactions with faculty.  A recommendation letter that says nothing but ""My class was hard; Oshan got an A."" is utterly useless. (We call them DWIC letters, for ""Did Well In Class"".)  Similarly, industry interships are only useful if they provide you with opportunities for intellectual creativity, or leverage for getting into a specific research project that you care about.  In particular, unless you actually care enough about image processing to want to do research on it, an internship doing image processing is just spinning your wheels.  The most important advice I can give is to talk to your potential research mentors as soon as possible. Ask them what they look for in potential undergraduate researchers. (They might say ""a high GPA"" or ""industry internships"", and then you have your answer.)  Ask them about their track record in placing students in top PhD programs.  Ask them what they would expect you to justify a strong recommendation letter. Ask them what sort of research they do, and how to get involved.  If they don't have time to work with you ask for pointers to interesting papers to read, problems to think about, projects to work on on your own.

cooking.stackexchange,29577,What is the difference between Milk Chocolate and Dark Chocolate?,"Short answer:  yes, milk chocolate differs from chocolate by the milk its manufacture.  Real chocolate (as opposed to many other confections) is made from chocolate liquer, which despite the name, is not alchoholic, or even liquid at room temperature.  The fruit of the theobroma cacao tree contains seeds, known as beans.  The harvested fruits are allowed to ferment, bringing many flavor and chemical changes to the beans, as well as removing the pulpy fruit.   The beans are then husked for the seeds inside, the nibs.  The nibs are the first true chocolate product, although they are not sweet.  The nibs are roasted, and then ground.  This is chocolate liquer, a solid colloid of cocoa fat and solid particles.  It would be solid at room temperature, but the grinding process melts it.  The cocoa liquer can be pressed to separate out the cocoa butter (as for use in the cosmetics industry), leaving cocoa powder, but that is not the point of your question.  Instead, to manufacture chocolate, the liquer is conched, a mechanical process that makes the suspended particles much smaller, part of what gives chocolate its smooth mouthfeel.   Various products can be made from chocolate liquer, or cocoa butter, including:    baking chocolate - essentially, just chocolate liquer, hardened and tempereded.  May or may not be fully conched, so may not be as smooth as chocolate intended for eating.  chocolate or dark chocolate - Chocolate liquer, possibly extra cocoa butter, and sugar.  Minor optional ingredients often included are vanilla or other flavorings, and lecithen, an emulsifier.  milk chocolate - Same as dark chocolate, with the addition of condensed milk or milk solids, depending on whether it is made via the Swiss method or the Hershey method  white chocolate - cocoa butter, plus sugar and other flavorings  chocolate chips - Another form of chocolate in a particular shape.  Many manufacturers don't make these from true chocolate, but rather substitute another fat which doesn't melt as easily as cocoa butter, for economy, and so the chips hold their shape in the oven  chocolate bunny - Chocolate molded into the shape of a bunny, then tempered and cooled  German's chocolate - A brand name of quite sweet dark chocolate    Chocolate labels which list ""cocoa percentage"" are saying what proportion of the chocolate is cocoa liquer or additional cocoa butter or cocoa solids--that is, stuff from nibs, as opposed to sugar or other flavorings.  The cocoa percentage for milk chocolate tends to be much lower than that of dark chocolates, although not every milk chocolate has a lower percentage than every dark chocolate.  See this question for information on tempering chocolate, which gives its snappy mouthfeel.   Edit:  On dairy products in dark chocolate:  I was very surprised at Lemontwist's comment, so I did some googling and found this article at Go Dairy Free:    A good quality dark or semi-sweet chocolate will only have sweetener /    sugar in some form added, and may also include a touch of soy lecithin    as an emulsifier. These brands are milk-free by ingredients, but keep    in mind that most brands of chocolate are made on shared equipment.    That is, an inherently milk-free dark chocolate may be made on the    same equipment as milk chocolate. See below for my note on    cross-contamination issues.   The complications arrive as some brands of dark and semi-sweet    chocolate do include milk ingredients for a “smoother” end result.    This is particularly true in mainstream brands like Hershey’s. Some    ways that you may see milk listed in the ingredients include milk    solids, milk, milk powder, whey, butter oil or butterfat (see the Ask    Alisa post on butter oil), or even casein. If milk is in the    ingredients, it should be listed in a clearly identifiable manner per    the labeling laws, but still, use caution.    This is still in line with the information I provided, as I did mention ""other flavorings"" in dark chocolate, and it is not a universal or even common practice as far as I know.  For people with strong allergies, the cross-contamination issue may be more of an issue.  Vegans would have more of an issue, as lecithen is a very common ingredient in chocolate of all types, and may be animal sourced.  Vegans would specifically need to reseearch and obtain chocolates that meet that standard.   Googling will find many such products, but I did not find an easy single reference list.

However, for small values, the because of the cube law, the volume of the cavity is not going to change by huge amounts--a 2.5 kg chicken will take almost as much stuffing as a 3 kg chicken.   From 2 to 3 kg, you are looking at a ratio of approximately 1.4 versus 1.7, or very approximately 80 percent as much stuffing.  For most cooks, this is in the noise, I would suspect.  However, speaking culinary:    You can simply look at your chicken and estimate the volume of the cavity, or stuff it until it is full--see item 2.  You can bake any excess stuffing separately in a casserole dish.  Or you can bake all of the stuffing (technically, now dressing) in a casserole, which is my preferred method--then the amount you want is directly proportional to the number of guests you have.*  Many folks, including myself, believe roasting the chicken (or turkey) without stuffing leads to better meat, is easier, and the chicken will certainly cook more quickly.

Refactoring works everywhere and is totally reliable (I've had issues with Eclipse messing up my source in strange ways). CTRL+G (where used) works everywhere. CTRL+T (implementations) keeps track of the most common instances that I use and shows them first.   Code completion and renaming suggestions are so clever that it's only when you go back to Eclipse that you realise how much it was doing for you. For example, consider reading a resource from the classpath by typing getResourceAsStream(""/ at this point Intellij will be showing you a list of possible files that are currently available on the classpath and you can quickly drill down to the one you want. Eclipse - nope.  The (out of the box) Spring plugin for Intellij is vastly superior to SpringIDE mainly due to their code inspections.

gardening.stackexchange,8189,Which is preferred: worm castings or worm casting tea?,"If you're talking about leachate (worm castings steeped in water), some gardeners say that this tea will have approximately the same benefit to plant growth as the pure composted worm castings themselves.   But studies have shown that, in the long run, using the castings directly in the soil will produce better plant growth, often far better, than does leachate obtained by steeping the castings in water. Some of those studies were carried out by Ohio State University, Mississippi State University, Colorado State University, Cornell and others. (citation needed)  But if your main objective is speed of results, then the teas solution will find their way into the plant’s system more quickly than waiting for the dried casting to be ""watered in"" over time. Castings tea can also be used as a foliar spray/wash for even faster results.  But ""tea"" production methods vary — so consider, if your tea is ""aerobically brewed"", you're also increasing the diversity of beneficial microbes and adding to the soil the environment needed to keep the beneficial organisms alive and multiplying in your soil; more so than can be typically obtained from the castings themselves.  The best solution to this argument is to do both — to receive the full benefits of worm casting, apply it directly to the soil as both as an admendment and an occasional top dressing around the base of the plants. Then give them a good drink of tea however often as you see fit — weekly would be ideal, depending on your supply — neither the tea nor the castings will burn your plants.

music.stackexchange,23963,Is True Bypass better than Buffered Bypass? Is it possible to be neither?,"TL;DR  Which is better? That's up to your ears. Both bypasses have trade-offs: True Bypass is the most pure and high-fidelity, but it exposes your signal to long-cable degradation (plus it's more expensive). Pedals with buffered bypass will color your tone (especially if you have many of them), but you can run long cables without worry.  More explanation  True Bypass means that when the pedal is not engaged, your guitar's signal travels directly to the pedal's output along a simple wire. This ensures that the pedal doesn't color the signal, preserving your guitar's tone with the highest possible fidelity. In other words, when the pedal is off, it's as if it's not even there. True Bypass is generally a feature on high-end, boutique pedals, in part because the necessary internal components are more expensive.  Pedal manufactures market True Bypass as the cleanest, most faithful bypass possible. And it is, except for one thing: guitar signals are high impedance. As a consequence, if you run a guitar's signal through a long enough cable, it will start to lose some of the high end. This is why it's hard to find guitar cables longer than about 30 feet, while its easy to find mic cables that are 100 feet or more; mic signals are low impedance and aren't susceptible to signal degradation over long cable lengths.  So if you plug your guitar into a 30-foot cable, plug the cable into a True Bypass pedal, and then plug the pedal into another 30-foot cable before it gets to the amp, the ""bypass is a simple wire"" nature of True Bypass means that when the pedal is off, you've effectively plugged your guitar into a 60-foot cable, and this will have a noticeable effect on your sound. The more True Bypass pedals in your chain, the longer the effective cable length when they're off, and so the more impedance loss your signal will suffer.  Buffered bypass is designed with exactly this scenario in mind. Instead of the bypass being a simple wire, the pedal runs the signal through a small buffering amp first. This solves the impedance issues and ensures that your guitar's signal won't degrade over the long cable length. But while buffering amps are very very clean, they can't possibly be as clean and true as a simple wire, and so your signal is affected, at least somewhat. The more buffered-bypass pedals in your chain, the more buffering amps your signal goes through, and so the more it's affected.

In most (all?) areas of computer science, the most competitive conferences are at least as highly regarded as the top journals.

As David Patterson (UC Berkeley), Larry Snyder (University of Washington), and Jeffrey Ullman wrote in Evaluating Computer Scientists and Engineers For Promotion and Tenure:    The evaluation of computer science and engineering faculty for    promotion and tenure has generally followed the dictate ""publish or    perish,"" where ""publish"" has had its standard academic meaning of    ""publish in archival journals"" [Academic Careers, 94].

You will actually get use out of proprietary software (iLife, etc).

You're OK conforming to forced upon and immutable design decisions. Keep reading 'different style laptop' and 'ui customization' below.    Buy a PC if:    Using Linux, you want to do anything.  As some have mentioned, ""linux is good for computer savvy people/developers.""  This is a misconception, as I have seen both smart and dumb users from age 7 to age 82 using Ubuntu with no trouble.  On the other end, I've seen advanced users with fully custom systems that do everything they want, and usually for no financial cost(time cost though).  You don't NEED apple software.  There are as good or better alternatives to any apple software.  You want more choices.  By buying a PC:  You have many choices for different manufacturers and hardware.  You can spend as much as you want to spend on a laptop, and don't have to pay a proprietary-software-tax to get it. (windows-preinstalled will have a slight added cost)  You can choose a different style laptop. I found my white polycarbonate/plastic macbook to be very uncomfortable, the speakers sucked, loud fan @ high CPU, and the plastic was cheap/got dirty.  Basically, be ready to get angry at design-over-functionality choices that Apple makes. At least the MBP doesn't have speakers right in the fan bay ><)  UI Customization.  Using Linux, you can literally make your user interface how you want it.  Things like OpenBox and more allow you to fine tune your experience.  Even windows has applications that let you modify your UI (to a degree).  As of the last time I used OSX, you basically have to suck up the way Apple decides to design your UI.  Software!. Running an ubuntu system, you can install software over the interwebs with ease using Package Managers. (Fink for Mac will do this too, not sure how well it works with everything though).  You can dual boot w/Linux or Windows, and even create a hackintosh.  I've seen OSX running well on a netbook. Nuff said.      In sum, and as some others have mentioned, buy a Mac if you NEED a mac(and, of course, if you really like the feel of the laptops/ui/etc).

The good thing about your own vehicle is that it will take you wherever you want to go, whenever you want to go. Even to the places that are not served by public transport. The downside is that crossing borders with a car increases hassle, this will be most notable when shipping your car around the Darien Gap.  The good thing about using public transport is that is easy and (likely) more expensive*.  *) Although public transport is considerably more expensive per mile traveled, I calculated that the costs for shipping (+handlings and border duties) around the Darien Gap is a big factor in the overall costs of doing this trip with your own vehicle. So driving your own vehicle may turn out to be more expensive. The more miles you travel, the cheaper driving your own vehicle will be.

Unless you are working for the few big dogs that have their own publishing department, your employer is working for an external publisher with the constant threat of canceling the contract.  The stress that management feels is passed on to you.  Trying to pull off a quality title on shrinking budgets and demands of people who may not care what you are trying to do in your title, but pay your salary, is quite the challenge.

Application development is pretty stable work, and while your clients can sometimes be crazy, they are not so quick to pull the contract cancellation card.  The difference is that they depend on you to help them get better at whatever it is they need.  They know that if nothing changes they can't improve their business.  Games on the other hand are for pure enjoyment, and publishers only care about making money.  Game development can be enjoyable, as long as you don't have any aspirations to go up against the big dogs.

Now here for some pros and cons:  Infant Friendliness  This has been discussed on the forum ad nauseam so I won't repeat this but just refer you to the question asked previously on this forum: US to Asia via Europe with infants  One thing that I would add to the information provided there is that American Airline is now going through Restructuring and a Merger with US Airways, this usually entails layoffs during consolidation, so this always weighs on employees minds, and while they are likely to keep being professional ""Freudian slips"" are more likely to happen.  Also I don't see Alex Cross any more on the list of movies available from United.

As far as baggage handling is concerned and speed of clearing border control and customs I would say it's about the same.  Personally I prefer Newark to JFK for location convenience but since you are only planning to stay the night and leave it won't matter much to you.  Quality of Surrounding Hotels  Depends entirely on your price range.  There are hotels like Sheraton, Hilton and Marriott, to Courtyard, DoubleTree, and Hilton Garden, to HoJo, Days Inn and Ramada, to no-name motels like JFK Inn, around both airports, so the choice is yours.  I would suggest picking it ahead of time and making reservations so you won't have to wait at the airport a long time for a pick up by a courtesy shuttle, which hotel normally provides for you.  Hotels around JFK will be slightly more expensive since they are located inside the New York City limits and also will carry higher taxes on the Rooms.  HOTELS AMENDMENT  Since your price range is < $200 total you're probably going to cover most hotels with ease.  Not being in the path of planes landing or taking off would be a little harder especially in JFK where depending on prevailing winds planes can land coming over the city to runway 22R.  So you need to be away from the glide path which means that your choices might be limited to: Days Inn, Best Western, Holiday Inn Express, Comfort Inn, HoJo, JFK Inn, and a couple of others.  Noise situation is better in Newark where hotels except for Marriott are located far enough away from the airport and away from glide paths I have stayed in a Courtyard on Frontage road and in EconoLodge on Route 1 and it's pretty quiet with reasonable prices but you can pick your as choices are plentiful.

music.stackexchange,10144,Is it easier to play on a Grand Piano than an Upright Piano?,"In my experience, it is usually easier to play a grand piano. A grand piano responds better in many ways, for example:    The dynamic scale is bigger. I find it much easier to get a good relaxed fortissimo from a grand.  The notes just ring longer. This makes cantabile playing easier and it's also easier to play slowly.  Combining the previous two, it's easier to separate layers of sound, like background, middle ground, foreground.     (Actually it's often initially easier to separate layers on an upright because the sound is not so rich and thus doesn't get muddy so easily. On a grand you have to do bigger contrasts to get a good sound. The point is, though, that you can make the contrasts big and then the layers really sound differentiated.)  For me, when I've played only on an upright for a long time, this is what takes most time to adjust. The bigger the instrument, the bigger you have to make the contrasts.   This all of course depends a lot on the acoustics of the room, too.    Using the soft pedal on a grand actually makes the sound different (the hammers are hitting fewer strings). So, yet more possible variation in sound.  The action is also different. On a grand the hammers hit the strings from below so gravity plays a bigger role. Perhaps for this reason for me a grand piano often feels heavy while an upright feels stiff. (Another reason might be psychological -- a grand piano has massive sound, thus the action feels massive). I like a heavy action, but hate a stiff one. As for how heavy/stiff, that varies very much between individual pianos. There are both light and heavy uprights and grands.  It's easier to play fast repetitions on a grand piano. Also in general a grand just seems to respond quicker. With the exception of the lowest notes, you can usually get shorter staccatos out of a grand.    This is all assuming that we're comparing instruments which are in similar condition. If course it will be easier to play on a good upright than a bad grand etc.  ",2,a Grand Piano,2,a Grand Piano,"[[47, 60], [62, 75], [211, 218], [585, 592], [1023, 1030], [1183, 1190], [1293, 1306], [1397, 1410], [1624, 1630], [1673, 1686], [1704, 1711], [1828, 1835], [1991, 1996]]",an Upright Piano,"[[500, 510], [788, 798], [1331, 1341], [1611, 1619], [1972, 1979]]"

Highlights: LINQ, LINQ to XML, LINQ, C#, LINQ, Garbage collector, LINQ, MonoTouch.Dialog, and a lot of other things.  Seriously, though.. nowadays most apps are always downloading data from the web, and you'll need to be converting that to objects, keeping them in lists, sorting and filtering them, and pushing them to databases. That stuff is so simple to do with C# and LINQ that I can't imagine people doing that in other languages.   The $400 dollar cost is not low, but you can probably make that money back in 1 month or so with no advertisement. And the amount of time MT will save you will offset that easily.

travel.stackexchange,3620,"Car rental vs. buying a car for 1 month, when visiting the USA?","Buying option  For a one-month trip, I do not recommend buying and selling a car.  Although it probably could be done, let me address some of the complications with that first, then I'll discuss rentals:    A $3000 car will be old, and probably not very reliable. I would not trust a car in this price range to get me safely around the country without thorough inspection, or a long test-drive/break-in period first.  Certainly you could get lucky, and have absolutely no problems with a $3000 car for a month of road trips.  But it would really ruin your vacation, I expect, if the car broke down in the middle of Arizona, or wherever.  Selling a car takes time.  If you're willing to lose $2000 in the selling process, though, it would be easy.  You could probably unload it at any car dealership for $2000 less than you paid a month before.  Registration is a pain.  Typically when you buy a car, you will get a temporary tag, and then have 30 days (although in some states fewer, I believe) to get an official registration.  If your stay is 30 days or less, this may not be a problem, since you would not be required to get an official tag.  But if you have the car 31 days or longer, you'll have to stop by a DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles) in some state, and get a license plate.  And doing that typically requires proof of residence of that state, which you probably won't have.  It will likely also require a vehicle inspection, at minimum to ensure the car is not stolen, and in many states, to ensure it passes environmental regulations.  If you register the car in the same state where you buy it, it will probably pass environmental regulations.  But if you register it in another state, it's anybody's guess.  It may be difficult to find a company that will provide you (affordable) insurance for a car you just bought, if you are not a U.S. resident.  Depending on the states where you buy and sell your car, it may actually be impossible to sell your car so quickly after having bought it, because you may not have the title in your possession yet.  And even if you have a title signed over to you, that may not be sufficient to sell it--you may have to get the state DMV (wherever you register the vehicle) to send you a new official title in your name before you can sell it again.  Selling the car in another state may be difficult, but I don't know. If you sell it to a dealership, they will likely take over most of the paper work involved--assuming it's possible.    Rental option  There are much cheaper options for rentals than the one you quoted.  A quick look at kayak.com shows that a rental from LAX (Los Angeles, CA) and drop-off at LGA (New York City, NY) a month later can be had for as little as $1792 including tax. Of course that does not include fuel, and likely does not include extra insurance.  You also may or may not be able to take this vehicle into Canada.  Different rental agencies will have different policies (and possibly extra costs) for taking it into Canada.  You'll just have to ask.  This rental option may take you over your $2000 budget, but you might be able to cut corners by renting multiple vehicles at different times during your stay.  If you'll be staying in L.A. for a week, for instance, maybe use public transport while you're there, and only rent a car at the end of your stay for the next leg of your journey.   You can also count on a more reliable car. If you pick a nation-wide rental company, they might change your car along the way in agencies and you have customer support if you have any mechanic problem. You also drive a quite recent car.

gardening.stackexchange,1351,Is a dethatching rake significantly better for removing thatch than a regular rake?,"Where in California (according to your SE profile) are you?  Am asking, as from my limited research (knowledge) on grass types used in California, I discovered:    Northern California tends to favour cool season lawns.  Southern California tends to favour warm season lawns.    If you do have a warm season lawn (grass type), for the overall health of your lawn you should only dethatch in Spring, once the grass has woken from dormancy & is actively growing.  Dethatching at any other time of year greatly increases the chance of causing real damage to a warm season lawn.  On the other hand, if you have a cool season lawn (grass type), without a shadow of a doubt the best time of year to treat, perform maintenance, on your lawn is late Summer, early Autumn (Fall). Around ""Labor Day"" in the USA is generally considered about ideal.  Now adding onto ""Mancuniensis"" answer, I recommend paying a visit to your local tool hire shop (store) and rent yourself a mechanically powered Dethatcher (a machine you walk behind, just like a lawnmower) for a ½ or full day.  Additionally, as you paint a picture of a bad thatch problem, I would also be very tempted to get hold of a mechanically powered Aerator and aerate your lawn after dethatching. Doing so will open up the soil, get some much needed air in there.

The cooking devices that many people refer to as ""hibachi"" are what the Japanese would call ""shichirin"":    I'm guessing that the term ""hibachi"" was popularized in North America because ""shichirin"" can be hard to pronounce for Anglophones.  Somewhere along the way, primarily in North America, the term ""hibachi"" also started to be used to refer to teppanyaki:    I'm not sure when or why this started; perhaps it has something to do with the fact that Banihana confusingly refers to their teppanyaki restaurants as ""hibachi-style"".

If you were to actually go to a Japanese restaurant and cook your own food over a shichirin, it would likely be referred to as ""yakiniku"", which is believed to have some origins in Korean barbecue.

cs.stackexchange,473,"Decision problems vs ""real"" problems that aren't yes-or-no","As you said, there is no decision to make, so new complexity classes and new types of reductions are needed to arrive at a suitable definition of NP-hardness for optimization-problems.  One way of doing this is to have two new classes NPO and PO that contain optimizations problems and they mimic of course the classes NP and P for decision problems. New reductions are needed as well. Then we can recreate a version of NP-hardness for optimization problems along the lines that was successful for decision problems. But first we have to agree what an optimization-problem is.  Definition: Let $O=(X,L,f,opt)$ be an optimization-problem. $X$ is the set of inputs or instances suitable encoded as strings. $L$ is a function that maps each instance $x\in X$ onto a set of strings, the feasible solutions of instance $x$. It is a set because there are many solutions to an optimization-problem. Thus we haven an objective function $f$ that tells us for every pair $(x, y)$ $y\in L(x)$ of instance and solution its cost or value. $opt$ tells us whether we are maximizing or minimizing.  This allows us to define what an optimal solution is: Let $y_{opt}\in L(x)$ be the optimal solution of an instance $x\in X$ of an optimization-problem $O=(X,L,f,opt)$ with $$f(x,y_{opt})=opt\{f(x,y')\mid y'\in L(x)\}.$$ The optimal solution is often denoted by $y^*$.  Now we can define the class NPO: Let $NPO$ be the set of all optimization-problems $O=(X,L,f,opt)$ with:    $X\in P$  There is a polynomial $p$ with $|y|\le p(|x|)$ for all instances $x\in X$ and all feasible solutions $y\in L(x)$. Furthermore there is an deterministic algorithm that decides in polynomial time whether $y\in L(x)$.  $f$ can be evaluated in polynomial time.    The intuition behind it is:    We can verify efficiently if $x$ is actually a valid instance of our optimization problem.  The size of the feasible solutions is bounded polynomially in the size of the inputs, And we can verify efficiently if $y\in L(x)$ is a fesible solution of the instance $x$.  The value of a solution $y\in L(x)$ can be determined efficiently.    This mirrors how $NP$ is defined, now for PO: Let $PO$ be the set of all problems from $NPO$ that can be solved by an deterministic algorithm in polynomial time.  Now we are able to define what we want to call an approximation-algorithm: An approximation-algorithm of an optimization-problem $O=(X,L,f,opt)$ is an algorithm that computes a feasible solution $y\in L(x)$ for an instance $x\in X$.  Note: That we don’t ask for an optimal solution we only what to have a feasible one.  Now we have two types of errors: The absolute error of a feasible solution $y\in L(x)$ of an instance $x\in X$ of the optimization-problem $O=(X,L,f,opt)$ is $|f(x,y)-f(x,y^*)|$.  We call the absolute error of an approximation-algorithm $A$ for the optimization-problem $O$ bounded by $k$ if the algorithm $A$ computes for every instance $x\in X$ a feasible solution with an absolute error bounded by $k$.  Example: According to the Theorem of Vizing the chromatic index of a graph (the number of colours in the edge coloring with the fewest number of colors used) is either $\Delta$ or $\Delta+1$, where $\Delta$ is the maximal node degree. From the proof of the theorem an approximation-algorithm can be devised that computes an edge coloring with $\Delta+1$ colours. Accordingly we have an approximation-algorithm for the $\mathsf{Minimum-EdgeColoring}$-Problem where the absolute error is bounded by $1$.  This example is an exception, small absolute errors are rare, thus we define the relative error $\epsilon_A(x)$ of the approximation-algorithm $A$ on instance $x$ of the optimization-problem $O=(X,L,f,opt)$ with $f(x,y)>0$ for all $x\in X$ and $y\in L(x)$ to be  $$\epsilon_A(x):=\begin{cases}0&f(x,A(x))=f(x,y^*)\\\frac{|f(x,A(x))-f(x,y^*)|}{\max\{f(x,A(x)),f(x,y^*)\}}&f(x,A(x))\ne f(x,y^*)\end{cases}$$  where $A(x)=y\in L(x)$ is the feasible solution computed by the approximation-algorithm $A$.  We can now define approximation-algorithm $A$ for the optimization-problem $O=(X,L,f,opt)$ to be a $\delta$-approximation-algorithm for $O$ if the relative error $\epsilon_A(x)$ is bounded by $\delta\ge 0$ for every instance $x\in X$, thus  $$\epsilon_A(x)\le \delta\qquad \forall x\in X.$$  The choice of $\max\{f(x,A(x)),f(x,y^*)\}$ in the denominator of the definition of the relative error was selected to make the definition symmetric for maximizing and minimizing. The value of the relative error $\epsilon_A(x)\in[0,1]$. In case of a maximizing problem the value of the solution is never less than $(1-\epsilon_A(x))\cdot f(x,y^*)$ and never larger than $1/(1-\epsilon_A(x))\cdot f(x,y^*)$ for a minimizing problem.  Now we can call an optimization-problem $\delta$-approximable if there is a $\delta$-approximation-algorithm $A$ for $O$ that runs in polynomial time.  We do not want to look at the error for every instance $x$, we look only at the worst-case. Thus we define $\epsilon_A(n)$, the maximal relativ error of the approximation-algorithm $A$ for the optimization-problem $O$ to be  $$\epsilon_A(n)=\sup\{\epsilon_A(x)\mid |x|\le n\}.$$  Where $|x|$ should be the size of the instance.  Example: A maximal matching in a graph can be transformed in to a minimal node cover $C$ by adding all incident nodes from the matching to the vertex cover. Thus $1/2\cdot |C|$ edges are covered. As each vertex cover including the optimal one must have one of the nodes of each covered edge, otherwise it could be improved, we have $1/2\cdot |C|\cdot f(x,y^*)$. It follows that $$\frac{|C|-f(x,y^*)}{|C|}\le\frac{1}{2}$$  Thus the greedy algorithm for a maximal matching is a $1/2$-approximatio-algorithm for $\mathsf{Minimal-VertexCover}$. Hence $\mathsf{Minimal-VertexCover}$ is $1/2$-approximable.  Unfortunately the relative error is not always the best notion of quality for an approximation as the following example demonstrates:  Example: A simple greedy-algorithm can approximate $\mathsf{Minimum-SetCover}$. An analysis shows that $$\frac{|C|}{|C^*|}\le H_n\le 1+\ln(n)$$ and thus $\mathsf{Minimum-SetCover}$ would be $\frac{\ln(n)}{1+\ln(n)}$-approximable.  If the relative error is close to $1$ the following definition is advantageous.  Let $O=(X,L,f,opt)$ be an optimization-problem with $f(x, y)>0$ for all $x\in X$ and $y\in L(x)$ and $A$ an approximation-algorithm for $O$. The approximation-ratio $r_A(x)$ of feasible solution $A(x)=y\in L(x)$ of the instance $x\in X$ is  $$r_A(x)=\begin{cases}1&f(x,A(x))=f(x,y^*)\\\max\left\{  \frac{f(x,A(x))}{f(x, y^*)},\frac{f(x, y^*)}{f(x, A(x))}\right\}&f(x,A(x))\ne f(x,y^*)\end{cases}$$  As before we call an approximation-algorithm $A$ an $r$-approximation-algorithm for the optimization-problem $O$ if the approximation-ratio $r_A(x)$ is bounded by $r\ge1$ for every input $x\in X$.  $$r_A(x)\le r$$  And yet again if we have an $r$-approximation-algorithm $A$ for the optimization-problem $O$ then $O$ is called $r$-approximable. Again we only care about to the worst-case and define the maximal approximation-ratio $r_A(n)$ to be  $$r_A(n)=\sup\{r_A(x)\mid |x|\le n\}.$$  Accordingly the approximation-ratio is larger than $1$ for suboptimal solutions. Thus better solutions have smaller ratios. For $\mathsf{Minimum-SetCover}$ we can now write that it is $(1+\ln(n))$-approximable. And in case of $\mathsf{Minimum-VertexCover}$ we know from the previous example that it is $2$-approximable. Between relative error and approximation-ratio we have simple relations:  $$r_A(x)=\frac{1}{1-\epsilon_A(x)}\qquad \epsilon_A(x)=1-\frac{1}{r_A(x)}.$$  For small deviations from the optimum $\epsilon<1/2$ and $r<2$ the relative error is advantageous over the approximation-ratio, that shows its strengths for large deviations $\epsilon\ge 1/2$ and $r\ge 2$.  The two versions of $\alpha$-approximable don’t overlap as one version has always $\alpha\le 1$ and the other $\alpha\ge 1$. The case $\alpha=1$ is not problematic as this is only reached by algorithms that produce an exact solution and consequentially need not be treated as approximation-algorithms.  Another class appears often APX. It is define as the set of all optimization-problems $O$ from $NPO$ that haven an $r$-approximation-algorithm with $r\ge1$ that runs in polynomial time.  We are almost through. We would like to copy the successful ideas of reductions and completness from complexity theory. The observation is that many NP-hard decision variants of optimization-problems are reducible to each other while their optimization variants have different properties regarding their approximability. This is due to the polynomialtime-Karp-reduction used in NP-completness reductions, which does not preserve the objective function. And even if the objective functions is preserved the polynomialtime-Karp-reduction may change the quality of the solution.  What we need is a stronger version of the reduction, which not only maps instances from optimization-problem $O_1$ to instances of $O_2$, but also good solutions from $O_2$ back to good solutions from $O_1$.  Hence we define the approximation-preserving-reduction for two optimization-problems $O_1=(X_1,L_1,f_1,opt_1)$ and $O_2=(X_2,L_2,f_2,opt_2)$ from $NPO$. We call $O_1$ $AP$-reducible to $O_2$, written as $O_1\le_{AP} O_2$, if there are two functions $g$ and $h$ and a constant $c$ with:    $g(x_1, r)\in X_2$ for all $x_1\in X_1$ and rational $r>1$  $L_2(g(x, r_1))\ne\emptyset$ if $L_1(x_1)\ne\emptyset$ for all $x_1\in X_1$ and rational $r>1$  $h(x_1, y_2, r)\in L_1(x_1)$ for all $x_1\in X_1$ and rational $r>1$ and for all $y_2\in L_2(g(x_1,r))$  For fixed $r$ both functions $g$ and $h$ can be computed by two algorithms in polynomial time in the length of their inputs.  We have $$f_2(g(x_1,r),y_2)\le r \Rightarrow f_1(x_1,h(x_1,y_2,r))\le 1+c\cdot(r-1) $$ for all $x_1\in X_1$ and rational $r>1$ and for all $y_2\in L_2(g(x_1,r))$    In this definition $g$ and $h$ depend on the quality of the solution $r$. Thus for different qualities the functions can differ. This generality is not always needed and we just work with $g(x_1)$ and $h(x_1, y_2)$.  Now that we have a notion of a reduction for optimization-problems we finally can transfer many things we know from complexity theory. For example if we know that $O_2\in APX$ and we show that $O_1\le_{AP} O_2$ it follows that $O_1\in APX$ too.  Finally we can define what we mean by $\mathcal{C}$-hard and $\mathcal{C}$-complete for optimization-problems:  Let $O$ be an optimization-problem from $NPO$ and $\mathcal{C}$ a class of optimization-problems from $NPO$ then $O$ is called $\mathcal{C}$-hard with respect to $\le_{AP}$ if for all $O'\in\mathcal{C}$ $O'\le_{AP} O$ holds.  Thus once more we have a notion of a hardest problem in the class. Not surprising a $\mathcal{C}$-hard problem is called $\mathcal{C}$-complete with respect to $\le_{AP}$ if it is an element of $\mathcal{C}$.  Thus we can now talk about $NPO$-completness and $APX$-completness etc. And of course we are now asked to exhibit a first $NPO$-complete problem that takes over the role of $\mathsf{SAT}$. It comes almost naturally, that $\mathsf{Weighted-Satisfiability}$ can be shown to be $NPO$-complete. With the help of the PCP-Theorem one can even show that $\mathsf{Maximum-3SAT}$ is $APX$-complete.

cooking.stackexchange,20951,What's the difference between gazpacho and normal soups?,"Gazpacho is possibly Spain's most famous chilled soup. The main difference aside form the temperature is that it's raw, meaning that the soup is not actually cooked it's just blended and chopped vegetables and occasionally bread. There is nothing inherently wrong with heating up gazpacho but it would lose its fresh texture and flavour which is why it's chilled and according to Wikipedia was popular with labourers who used it to:    ""cool off during the summer and to use available ingredients such as fresh vegetables and stale bread""    The main reason you couldn't just chill a normal soup and call it gazpacho is because gazpacho is made up of by no means just tomato. It contains tomatoes, a bit of garlic, cucumber, occasionally bread, some vinegar for tang and a drizzle of olive oil at the end.  If you wanted to make it your own (after all you're the chef!) you could add some Tabasco, bell peppers, spring onions or croutons at the end, basically anything you might find in a salsa dip. Use your common sense for what not to add but even in Spain they have variations that are not at all like what I would think of as gazpacho: in La Mancha they use it like a stew and add game (usually rabbit) and even wild mushrooms!

academia.stackexchange,42889,Should those more interested in research choose a postdoc or teaching position?,"In my discipline, mathematics, there is a huge range of tenure track positions, from very strongly research oriented positions to positions that are entirely oriented towards teaching.  Most new PhD's would prefer to end up in a more research oriented position, but most tenure track faculty positions are not at that end of the spectrum.  This means that a lot of new PhDs will ultimately have to settle for something less than the research oriented position that they have dreamed of.    If you're only willing to accept a research oriented tenure track position and would not accept a teaching oriented position then you should focus your efforts on getting a research oriented post-doc.   If you are most interested in a research oriented position but would at least be willing to consider taking a somewhat more teaching oriented position, then you should make an attempt to get some teaching experience by doing some teaching during your post-doc or by taking a position that is  designed to mix research and teaching. For example, Dartmouth has named instructorships in mathematics with a teaching load of one course per quarter.    There are also non tenure track faculty positions (typically called ""visiting assistant professor."")  These are a good way to get teaching experience but it is extremely difficult to get any research accomplished while teaching a load of 3-4 courses per semester in such a position.  These positions are sometimes created to temporarily fill the vacancy created by when a tenured faculty member leaves or retires.

You could use RL here too, but only if you have a reward function.  Apprentiship learning via inverse reinforcement learning will try to infer the goal of the teacher. In other words, it will learn a reward function from observation, which can then be used in reinforcement learning.

music.stackexchange,10512,Why is a grand piano better than an upright piano?,"It's all about the size, and therefore the length of the strings and the size of the vibrating surface of the wooden soundboard.  Even a baby grand at ~5 feet is longer than a typical upright is tall. A concert grand at 7-10 feet is much, much longer.  I can't do any better than what Wikipedia says, so I'm going to quote wholesale:    All else being equal, longer pianos with longer strings have larger, richer sound and lower inharmonicity of the strings. Inharmonicity is the degree to which the frequencies of overtones (known as partials or harmonics) sound sharp relative to whole multiples of the fundamental frequency. This results from the piano's considerable string stiffness; as a struck string decays its harmonics vibrate, not from their termination, but from a point very slightly toward the center (or more flexible part) of the string. The higher the partial, the further sharp it runs. Pianos with shorter and thicker string (i.e. small pianos with short string scales) have more inharmonicity. The greater the inharmonicity, the more the ear perceives it as harshness of tone.  Inharmonicity requires that octaves be stretched, or tuned to a lower octave's corresponding sharp overtone rather than to a theoretically correct octave. If octaves are not stretched, single octaves sound in tune, but double—and notably triple—octaves are unacceptably narrow. Stretching a small piano's octaves to match its inherent inharmonicity level creates an imbalance among all the instrument's intervallic relationships, not just its octaves. In a concert grand, however, the octave ""stretch"" retains harmonic balance, even when aligning treble notes to a harmonic produced from three octaves below. This lets close and widespread octaves sound pure, and produces virtually beatless perfect fifths. This gives the concert grand a brilliant, singing and sustaining tone quality—one of the principal reasons that full-size grands are used in the concert hall. Smaller grands satisfy the space and cost needs of domestic use.    Really tall uprights do exist, but they're not very common. They are sometimes referred to as upright grands.  Of course, whether inharmonicity is good or bad is purely subjective. That classic ""pub piano"" sound, fits perfectly with some kinds of music. It's the sound of an upright, and probably couldn't be replicated on a concert grand.

Engine-wise, it should not differ too much from OO since Symphony is a derivative fork from the OO project under IBM's heading. For now, underpinnings should still be the same, however it is not too impossible to expect that Symphony will start having major internal differences as time goes by, and IBM starts deviating Symphony from OO more in order to suit their own objectives better.  You would be right in saying that for now, the main differences between Symphony and OO would be the IBM branding and different interface. However, the interface is NOT just slightly different, and actually constitutes major differences in how you work in the office suite.

travel.stackexchange,44518,Why is Mumbai - London - Dallas - Denver more expensive than Bangalore - Mumbai - London - Dallas - Denver?,"See our question on hidden city ticketing.    From PriceofTravel, on why it happens:    Airfare pricing is extremely complicated and often an airline has the    choice of running certain segments at a loss by discounting seats, or    a bigger loss by flying mostly empty with higher fares. They need to    get their planes back into the more profitable positions on their    route map, so they discount heavily only when they have to, and    they’ll balance that with profits on routes that other airlines aren’t    bothering with at all.    So perhaps at this time of year, Bangalore to Mumbai can be easily discounted for a small loss by the airline, and then get more bodies onto the pricier flights, making them always have full planes there, and this works out as less of an issue for them than just making the Mumbai->Denver routes cheaper.  Sometimes when the last segment is the pricey one, and you're only going to say, B instead of C, on a A-B-C route, it's sometimes cheaper to buy the longer, cheaper flight and throw away the last ticket. Of course, this doesn't work if you need to get to C.  We have several questions on this (search throwing away, or not taking tickets).   As an example, a friend bought a Bolivia->Chile return flight, because it was cheaper than the one-way flight. He just threw away the second ticket :) Airlines do frown on it, however...  I also recommend that PriceofTravel article on Hidden Ticketing for a longish read anyway, it's quite eye-opening.

gardening.stackexchange,13580,Tomatoes...what is the difference between early blight and late blight?,"Here's the biggest difference: Late blight is caused by the pathogen Phytophthora infestans, while early blight is caused by Alternaria solani.  Phytophthora infestans is an oomycete, a fungus-like eukaryotic microorganism. It is similar to Alternaria solani (a fungus) in that it is a localized disease, and doesn't spread internally. P. infestans is a more aggressive disease, and spreads much faster than A. solani. It also kills all infected material, causing dark, watery spots to form. these eventually become hard and brown.  Control of P. infestans is very difficult. There is no cure for badly infected plants.    If you notice signs of infection, remove all affected parts and destroy them.  If the disease spreads anyway, destroy the entire plant.    You can prevent it to some extent by:    Rotating your crops every year, remembering that both tomatoes and potatoes are susceptible to P. infestans.  Destroying all affected crops as soon as possible. Remove them from the site, and burn them, or place in air-tight bags and send to the landfill. Do not compost.  Growing resistant varieties like 'Defiant', 'Plum Regal', 'Mountain Magic 'and 'Mountain Merit'    Control of A. solani is easier, but it's best to prevent the disease, or catch it early. From: Sudden Outbreak of Yellow Leaves on Tomato (and Other) Plants:    Remove all leaves showing signs of early blight (yellowing, dry margin, large to small round dead spots.)  Do not touch the unaffected leaves with the removed portions, or your hands until they are thoroughly washed.  Spray with a copper fungicide (like BONIDE© Liquid Copper Fungicide). Apply once every 5 days, and after any rain. Continue for 3-4 weeks, or until the plant stops developing the symptoms.     To prevent future attacks, you can try to:    Minimize soil-foliage contact  Make sure the plants get good air circulation (including proper spacing)  When you water, try not to wet the foliage, or splash soil onto the leaf undersides. The fungus spreads faster in wet conditions.  To go along with that, an organic mulch will help keep soil from splashing, and is also useful for many other reasons.  Make sure the plants have a support to climb on.  Rotate the plantings each year, to stop pathogens from inhabiting the soil. Remember that potatoes are also vulnerable to early blight, so plan accordingly.    ",1,Neutral,2,early blight,"[[99, 111], [1371, 1383]]",late blight,"[[31, 42]]"

In this case, I'm not crazy about the second solution for a few reasons:    There's always a small intellectual burden when defining classes and their relationships. It's not clear what benefit the nested class provides aside from partitioning code. The one class approach is simple and clear.  I'm not crazy about nested public classes. This implies I should be able to instantiate it outside of the SearchClass context which doesn't make a lot of sense.  Inheriting generic collections isn't my favorite. When I run into this class, it's not immediately clear that it's just a plain old ReadOnlyCollection<LocalFile>. I don't like the extra step of remembering what's behind the curtain.    Additionally, you may want some sort of static method to create your SearchClass. In your example, the class runs processing in the constructor which doesn't allow it to gracefully fail.

softwareengineering.stackexchange,81713,Readability vs minimalism/compactness/conciseness in language design: are they antagonistic?,"Conciseness is not the same thing as readability. Nor is verbosity the same thing as unreadability. Readability is a function of expressiveness (how much the syntax communicates), not length. There is often a correlation (up to a point) between conciseness and readability, but don't mistake that for causation.  To the case at hand, the people complaining that the new version lacks readability are most likely rationalizing their irrational fear of change, even positive change. A very large number of languages use similar literals to denote arrays and associative arrays (dictionaries, hashes) without any apparent penalty to expressiveness or readability.

cs.stackexchange,43236,Is a 2 address machine more likely to follow a RISC or CISC design?,"The problem is that the terms RISC and CISC are marketing terms, not science or engineering terms.  The terms are supposedly acronyms for ""Reduced Instruction Set Computing"" and ""Complex Instruction Set Computing.""  Your assumption that 3 addresses is much more complicated than 0 addresses is logical, but there is no logic here, and typically 3-address instructions are associated with RISC and 2-address instructions are associated with CISC (and 1-address and 0-address instructions aren't very common any more, so aren't associated with either RISC or CISC).  The term RISC is generally associated with instruction sets that have the following characteristics:    Fixed width instructions.  Usually 32-bits or 16-bits.  This makes it easier for the instruction decoder to find the boundaries between instructions.  In CISC machines, by contrast, the different instructions can range in length from 8-bits to as much 64-bits.  This makes the job of the instruction decoder somewhat harder in CISC machines, but can result in programs consuming less memory.  Fewer operand addressing modes.  In a RISC machine typically each operator (add, sub, jmp, load) has only one available addressing mode for its operands (the a, b, c, d, and e in your picture.)  Typically for arithmetic type instructions (add, sub, xor, ...) the only available addressing mode is register direct.  The source operands are found in registers, and the result of the computation can only be placed in a register. Load and store type instructions typically have one operand that is register direct and the other operand is register indirect plus offset.  Jump and branch type instructions will typically have a target operand that is pc relative.   There will typically also be a few jump and branch type instructions with a register indirect target, and sometimes a jump instruction with an absolute target operand.  The smaller number of operand addressing modes is typically the only way in which ""RISC"" instruction sets are actually reduced (compared to ""CISC"" instruction sets).  The reasoning, again, has to do with trying to keep the instruction decoder as simple as possible in RISC machines.  The simple operand addressing modes are easier to implement in a simple pipeline, and so the decoder in modern CISC machines often has to do extra work to crack instructions with complex operand modes into sequences of micro-operations that are more like RISC instructions.  There is a tendency for RISC architectures to have more register names available.  Many RISC architectures have 32 registers, while many CISC architectures have only 8 or 16.  This again has to do with making it somewhat simpler to exploit instruction-level parallelism with a simple pipeline.  Having more available register names makes it possible for the compiler to use different register names for unrelated computations, without requiring the hardware to do register renaming.  RISC architectures tend to have ""3-address"" instructions, while CISC architectures tend to have mostly ""2-address"" instructions.  The notion of ""3-address"" vs. ""2-address"" is also somewhat fuzzy (and somewhat mis-named).  Every add instruction has 3 operands, 2 source operands and 1 destination operand.  The real distinction is whether those operands are explicit or implicit.  In a so-called ""3-address"" instruction you make all 3 operands explicit.  In a so-called ""2-address"" instruction you make the destination operand explicit and one of the source operands explicit.  The third source operand is implicit: it is always the same address as the destination operand.  In a so-called ""1-address"" instruction only one of the source operands is explicit.  The other source operand is implicitly either an accumulator register or the top of the stack, as is the destination operand.  Finally in a ""0-address"" instruction all the operands are implicit (usually the two source operands are the top two values on the stack and the destination goes back on the top of the stack.)    To sum up: these are all marketing terms, and don't really mean much.  The important concepts have to do with the relationship between different instruction-set design choices and how those choices make it easier or harder to implement hardware pipelines.

academia.stackexchange,20655,Better chances for math grad school: graduate in three years or four?,"What jumps out at me in your question is the assumption that because of your advanced standing you can only stay at Berkeley for two years and thus only spend three years in college altogether.  Though I do not have any direct experience with this (i.e., financial aid at state universities in California), I find that quite surprising.  Berkeley is an elite institution, and presumably they don't let just anyone transfer in.  The fact that you have two years' worth of university credit after one year in college is to your credit and probably factored into their decision to accept you.  So they turn around and penalize you by only offering you two years of financial aid?  That doesn't make much sense.   I would at least make a phone call and, if necessary, schedule an in-person appointment with a financial aid officer.  My first guess, honestly, is that you may not be understanding the situation correctly.  If you are, you need to explain why the junior standing could stop you from making best use of the amazing resources that UC Berkeley has to offer and could make you less competitive in your later academic plans.  I would expect them to be sympathetic to that.  On the other hand, I find your discussion of what it takes to get into a top mathematics program (here and in the other question you asked) a bit reductive.  It is not simply a matter of taking the most graduate courses, doing multiple REUs (in my opinion as someone who was involved in graduate admissions in my math department, one REU has the same effect as multiple REUs unless you do some truly notable research in one of the REUs, which is unusual; also, doing multiple REUs makes it natural for you to get more than one recommendation letter from an REU director, and this is a mistake: most REU letters sound the same no matter who is writing them or is being written about), and so forth: the goal that you rather want to pursue is to show mastery of mathematics and show the potential and the interest in doing mathematical research.  You can show this by taking 5 graduate courses rather than 10.  (Ten courses sounds almost ridiculously high, by the way: I took 9 trimester graduate courses -- so the equivalent of 6 semester courses -- over the last two years of my undergraduate program.  I got into all the top mathematics departments.  If I had taken a few courses fewer I don't think the outcome would have changed.)    In fact, the list of math courses that you've already taken compares well with what very strong undergraduates take up through the end of their second year in top mathematics programs in the US.  If you did really well with them, then I think you would be ready to take graduate courses (what other undergraduate courses would you take?) in your next year and thus as far as I can see you could graduate in three years and still be competitive for a top program.  But do you really have to?  If you are serious about studying mathematics, then you have the entire rest of your life to do that.  I would recommend a more balanced undergraduate experience that is not 100% calculated to optimize the graduate program you can get into and which lasts for the traditional four years: there are other interesting courses to take as an undergraduate which you will never take again, and there are other things to do with one's undergraduate life aside from coursework.

softwareengineering.stackexchange,91841,Python template engines: What are the real benifits and drawbacks to XML vs custom syntax,"I think the consideration should probably be about how the templates are going to be written. The point of templates is to make sure that people are no longer hand coding (html, LaTeX, xml, whatever). This is why templating engines allow inheritance and other fancy features.  So, Daniel Roseman has a good point when he says that getting humans to write XML is evil. To some extent, you're using templates so you don't have to do that.   With that in mind, the largest difference I've seen between python templating engines is not, in fact, whether they use XML or some custom syntax. The large difference seems to be whether or not the templating engines allow arbitrary python code to be embedded into the template.  You mentioned both Cheetah and Jinja2. Both have special syntax but Cheeta allows pretty much arbitrary python to be embeded in the template, while Jinja2 places heavy restrictions on what can be done with the template. Now you're looking at a trade off between potentially mixing business and presentation logic, with making your template clear and concise.  In the end, the benefits are going to come from how easy it is to read, write, re-read, and  re-write your code.  ",1,Neutral,2,XML,"[[355, 358], [559, 562]]",custom syntax,"[[566, 584]]"

cooking.stackexchange,29787,Why does Chinese food reheats better on stove than in microwave?,"I believe it has more to do with HOW a microwave cooks or reheats food vs. the way a conventional stove top does it.  When you put something into a microwave to reheat it, it does not apply heat the way a stove does. Microwaves use their namesakes -microwave radiation- to jostle the molecules contained within the food, causing friction, which in turn causes heat, and heats up the food, from the inside out. This means that food with a higher density, such as meat or veggies, will heat up more quickly than liquids, which are less dense. Also, microwaves don't just heat up the food, but also the container, be it plastic, foam, or the stereotypical white paper boxes. When this happens, the particles within the container (which are being heated) will give off various chemicals, which can alter the taste of food.   When you reheat food on a stove top, you are using a container that is much more resistant to heat (a pan) and you are applying heat evenly, from the outside of the food, regardless of it's density. This means that the pan (90% of the time) will not alter the way your food tastes, and because everything is being heated at the same time and rate, your food tastes more like it did yesterday, or whenever it was that you brought it home.

cs.stackexchange,54951,Multi-threading vs. Interrupt Handlers,"Threads  On a platform that supports multi-threading the threads run in parallel.  That means that multiple threads can run at the same time.  This depends on the numbers of cores the CPU makes available.  If the programmer insists on running more threads than the CPU has cores then the threads will be time-sliced.  How much time each thread gets depends on the priority of that thread.  A thread can also choose to yield, which means that it will transfer execution time to another thread before its time slice is up.  If a thread does not yield the scheduler (which is part of the operating system) will pause the thread and force another thread to run.    Interrupt handler  An interrupt handler interrupts the main program. That means that the state of the thread is saved and execution is paused.  The interrupt handler is executed and when the interrupt handler yields the state of the main program is restored and execution of the main program resumes.    In many systems the interrupt handler is assigned a standard interruption schedule, e.g. 50 times a second.  The interrupt is always given preference over the main program, so if the interrupt takes up a lot of time the main program will get very little or no time to run. The interrupt gets scheduled no matter what. The main program gets whatever time is left over.  An interrupt handler is not subject to a scheduler, although possibly the interrupt can be interrupted by another interrupt.    Time slicing  In contrast, threads (insofar as threads outnumber CPU cores) are time sliced. Every thread gets the same amount of time. If there is a high priority thread it may get more time or get scheduled more often, but the scheduler makes sure every thread does get a time slot now and then.    Interrupts don't play nice  Because an interrupt handler will get prioritized over the main execution it is unwise to treat it like a thread. If you do heavy calculation in an interrupt handler your main program will never run!  This is made worse by the fact that interrupts are usually scheduled to run many times a second.    Alternatives  There is an alternative to abusing the interrupt handler for multi-threading.  You can use fibers on Arduino.  Fibers are cooperative threads, that means that a single thread will run until it yields.  After a yield the next fiber in line will run.  As long as all fibers yield in a cooperative manner this works very much like real pre-emptive threads.  If one fiber does not yield, none of the other fibers will get any running time.  This is the multi-tasking mechanism that was used in Windows 3.x    Just to make things confusing libraries that support this behavior talk about threading, not fibers.  Note that threading is impossible on Arduino, so these misnamed 'threads' are really fibers.

travel.stackexchange,13409,Getting to Cappadocia: Nevsehir or Kayseri Airport?,"  Your reasoning is correct.   Kayseri + rental car is the most convenient option.     You have much more choice to and from Kayseri: better schedules and better prices, through competition. Moreover, the car rental facilities tend to be better at Kayseri. And it is not that further. Anyway, the drive is a quite relaxed one.     Renting a car is definitely a good idea to explore that region. You will be more flexible. Getting from Göreme to more remote places like Mustafapaşa, Ihlara Valley or Kaymaklı is much easier and quicker with a car than with public transport. And you will be at ease to visit Kayseri. Indeed, if you have the time, stop by for a couple of hours. It's worth it.  An alternative would be to use an airport transfer, pulbic transport when possible and eventually take part in organised trips to the more remote areas or rent a car for that purpose on a daily basis. The organisational effort is however much bigger. You also lose some flexibility and spontaneity.   A last word on the airports. Check carefully if your flight to Kayseri is operated from Istanbul Atatürk Airport (code IST). There is another airport called  Sabiha Gökçen (code SAW). The latter is 50 kilometers from what one would call the city center. And transportation to and from this airport is by far not as straightforward as from Atatürk airport.

softwareengineering.stackexchange,110227,Writing robust code vs. overengineering,"  How do you guys know that you are writing the most robust code    possible without overengineering?    What do you consider robust code? Code that is already future proof and so powerful that it can deal with any situation? Wrong, no one can predict the future! And wrong again, because it'll be a complicated, unmaintainable mess.  I follow various principles: First and foremost YAGNI (yet) and KISS, so I don't write unecessary code. That also effectively prevents overengineering. I refactor the application when extensions are needed. Modern refactoring tools let you quite easily create interfaces and exchange implementations afterwards when you need them.  Then I try to make the code I write as robust as possible, that includes eliminating as many paths the program can take (and also states) as possible and a bit of Spartan programming. A great help are ""atomic"" functions/methods that do not rely on external states or at least don't leave the program in an inconsistend state when they fail. If you do that well, it's also very unlikely that you'll ever end up with spaghetti code and it's a blessing for maintainability, too. Also, in object oriented design, the SOLID principles are a great guide to robust code.  I've really found out that often times you can reduce complexity, for example combinatorial explosions of program paths or states, by deeply thinking about how you could design it as the straightest path possible. Try to keep the possible combinations at a minimum by choosing the best ordering of your subroutines and designing them for this purpose.  Robust code is most always simple and clean code, but simplicity is a trait that is not always easily achieved. Yet, you should strive for it. Always just write the simplest code possible and only add complexity when you have no other choice.   Simplicity is robust, complexity is fragile.   Complexity kills.

The primary reason why you'd want to create your own notes is that for many courses, a single good text is not available, and as a result, the instructor has to cobble together material from a number of different sources to produce a coherent set of lecture notes—or recommend that students work with multiple source texts. (Given the out-of-control nature of textbook prices, the latter alternative is unlikely to work out well.)  If you have a single-text class, it may not be necessary to provide students an additional set of notes, provided your lectures stick to the main text material. However, if you bring in alternative or additional topics into your lectures, you may want to include notes for those topics, and refer students to the textbook for places where you follow the ""standard"" outline.

softwareengineering.stackexchange,22416,Is embedded programming closer to electrical engineering or software development?,"If you want to be good at working on embedded systems, then yes, you need to think like a EE some of the time.  That is generally when you are writing code to interface with the various peripherals (serial busses like UART, SPI, I2C or USB), 8 and 16-bit timers, clock generators, and ADCs and DACs.  ""Datasheets"" for microcontrollers often run into the hundreds of pages as they describe every bit of every register.  It helps to be able to read a schematic so you can probe a board with an oscilloscope or logic analyzer.  At other times, it is just writing software.  But under tight constraints: often you won't have a formal OS or other framework, and you might have only a few KB of RAM, and maybe 64 KB of program memory.  (These limits are assuming you are programming on smaller 8 or 16-bit micros; if you are working with embedded Linux on a 32-bit processor, you won't have the same memory constraints but you will still have to deal with any custom peripheral hardware that your Linux distro doesn't provide drivers for.)  I have a background in both EE and CS so I enjoy both sides of the coin.

The living and working environments are excellent. Cost of living (apart from housing) is lower than UK. The transport system is also excellent.  Cost of accommodation is the only negative. Apartment rental costs are high - comparable to London. However, if you are appointed on expat terms the University will provide an apartment and the rent will be subsidised; all large companies that employ expat staff take account of accommodation costs. But you should make sure that you know what type of apartment is on offer and that it meets your family needs. 'Landed properties' form a very small part of Singapore's accommodation, the large majority are high-rise apartments.

music.stackexchange,6401,"What's the difference between ""modal music"" and ""tonal music""?","""Modal"" and ""tonal"" both describe works that:    have one defined ""home"" pitch, or ""tonal center,"" around which the melody and harmony are based;  have only one tonal center at a time, though that tonal center can change throughout a piece; and  use a seven-note diatonic scale as their pitch collections.    The difference between modal and tonal are in the harmonic languages surrounding the tonal center.  Tonality implies the system of common-practice harmony well-established by the eighteenth century that uses major and minor keys.  The tonal center of a tonal work is the first note of the major or minor scale in use as the pitch collection.  The harmonic implications of tonality are more than just the use of major and minor scales, as functional harmony is also a feature of tonal music.  The progression from the dominant sonority (a major triad with or without a minor seventh from the triad root based on the fifth note of the major or minor scale in use, or a similar-sounding substitute such as a fully-diminished seventh chord based on the leading tone) to the tonic triad to end a work is just one characteristic of functional harmony.  This characteristic is so important that, if the dominant sonority is instead a minor chord (thereby lacking the leading tone), the work no longer sounds tonal.  This means that even in a minor key, the seventh note of the scale is very often raised so that it becomes the leading tone.  Modal music uses diatonic scales that are not necessarily major or minor and does not use functional harmony as we understand it within tonality.  The term modal is most often associated with the eight church modes.  The tonal center of these modes is called its ""final.""  All the church modes use a pattern of half and whole steps that could be played on the white keys of a piano.  You may notice that there are only four different patterns among the church modes; the difference between e.g. ""dorian"" and ""hypodorian"" is whether the final occurs at or near the bottom of the melodic range or whether the final occurs in the middle of the melodic range.  The term ""modal"" has expanded in more modern music to encompass any non-tonal music that uses a diatonic pitch collection and has a tonal center.  There are many types of music other than modal and tonal.  Some examples include:    chromatic music, which uses all twelve of the standard Western pitch classes instead of the diatonic pitch collection, and which may or may not have a tonal center;  serial music, sometimes called ""dodecaphonic,"" which is chromatic music that intentionally avoids a tonal center, often by avoiding repetition of a pitch class until all twelve pitch classes have been used;  bitonal or polytonal music, which uses multiple diatonic pitch collections and multiple tonal centers simultaneously;  microtonal music, which uses pitches with frequencies between those of the standard twelve Western pitch classes;  whole-tone music, which uses a six-note scale comprised entirely of whole steps; and  non-Western music, which uses a pitch collection outside the twelve Western pitches (this is not a good classification, as there are many cultures with many different kinds of music that are very different from one another in pitch collection).    I did not even touch on music that does not use pitches at all; for example, an unpitched percussion work would clearly not be modal or tonal.  There are entire books on functional harmony, modes, etc., but I hope this has been a reasonable summary to answer your question.

gardening.stackexchange,4599,"For fruit trees, is it better to plant a single multigrafted tree, or multiple trees in one hole?",The question is where you want the competition for resources to take place. On multi grafted trees some of the grafts may grow faster due to their position or vigour. I have seen trees like this where one of the grafts fails but you are still getting fruit from the others.  By planting three trees in one hole you are putting the competition for nutrients and water at the root level.  If one fails you still have the others.  These are solutions for gardeners with limited space who have the time and interest to work with trees that are higher maintenance.    If you have lots of space plant one tree of each type at the usual spacing.    If space is at a premium and you don't mind the cost of buying three plants then plant them all in the same planting hole.    If you don't have space or enough money to buy three trees then try one multi graft.    Edit: The advantages of multi graft or multi stem apple trees is that the different types can pollinate each other. If you only have room for one tree or one clump and there are no other apple trees around this is real advantage.  Both types of grafted trees require more skill and time to prune.  You have to ensure that all parts are getting enough light.  A clump of different apple types could get a bit tricky to prune but nothing out of the ordinary.  I don't think the yield of fruit or quality will be any different between the two types so it comes down to space available and price.  ,1,Neutral,2,to plant a single multigrafted tree,"[[589, 603]]",multiple trees in one hole,"[[278, 310], [723, 763]]"

The only real difference in the beans is that some beans taste better at a higher roast than others, so they are more appropriate for espresso.  Your Italian grocery coffee company may be using the espresso label for marketing purposes, but in general, espresso coffee beans can be the same beans that are used for ""regular"" coffee, but roasted to a French or Italian roast level, which is darker than City or Full City.  Since the advent of Starbucks, many roasts are much darker than they used to be.  Dunkin' Donuts coffee, which is a Full City roast, used to be the norm, but now a French seems to be what you can buy.    I roast my own coffee and take it to just into the second crack which is, generally, a Full City roast...a point where the character of the coffee predominates rather than the flavor of the roast.  There is more information about roasts at Sweet Marias where I buy my green beans, and reading through the site will give you way more of a coffee education than you probably ever wanted.   So, yes, you can use the coffee you have to make brewed coffee.  It will probably be roastier than you would normally have, unless it is just a marketing ploy, in which case it will taste normal.  Consider how long you have had this coffee; if it has been shelved for a while ""normal"" probably won't be all that great, since freshly roasted coffee is, generally, way better than old coffee.

Passive pickups tend to lose the extremes of high and low frequencies, but still give a very even and punchy tone. This is because passive pickups tend to push out more midrange frequencies. While passive pickups might give players less dynamic control, their smooth sound is still very unique and desirable.  Active Pickups: Active pickups have preamps that are built into the pickup housing; so they can drive the signal to the amp themselves. This preamp must be powered by a source other than the amp, so active pickups require a separate battery to operate. This allows the pickup to send a higher output signal, producing a more complete, full-range sound than most passive pickup systems and giving players more control of instrument dynamics, projection and tone.

softwareengineering.stackexchange,97207,What does C++ do better than D?,"Most of the things C++ ""does"" better than D are meta things: C++ has better compilers, better tools, more mature libraries, more bindings, more experts, more tutorials etc.  Basically it has more and better of all the external things that you would expect from a more mature language. This is inarguable.  As for the language itself, there are a few things that C++ does better than D in my opinion. There's probably more, but here's a few that I can list off the top of my head:  C++ has a better thought out type system  There are quite a few problems with the type system in D at the moment, which appear to be oversights in the design. For example, it is currently impossible to copy a const struct to a non-const struct if the struct contains class object references or pointers due to the transitivity of const and the way postblit constructors work on value types. Andrei says he knows how to solve this, but didn't give any details. The problem is certainly fixable (introducing C++-style copy constructors would be one fix), but it is a major problem in language at present.  Another problem that has bugged me is the lack of logical const (i.e. no mutable like in C++). This is great for writing thread-safe code, but makes it difficult (impossible?) to do lazy intialisation within const objects (think of a const 'get' function which constructs and caches the returned value on first call).  Finally, given these existing problems, I'm worried about how the rest of the type system (pure, shared, etc.) will interact with everything else in the language once they are put to use. The standard library (Phobos) currently makes very little use of D's advanced type system, so I think it is reasonable the question whether it will hold up under stress. I am skeptical, but optimistic.  Note that C++ has some type system warts (e.g. non-transitive const, requiring iterator as well as const_iterator) that make it quite ugly, but while C++'s type system is a little wrong at parts, it doesn't stop you from getting work done like D's sometimes does.  Edit: To clarify, I believe that C++ has a better thought out type system -- not necessarily a better one -- if that makes sense. Essentially, in D I feel that there is a risk involved in using all aspects of its type system that isn't present in C++.  D is sometimes a little too convenient  One criticism that you often hear of C++ is that it hides some low-level issues from you e.g. simple assignments like a = b; could be doing many things like calling conversion operators, calling overload assignment operators etc., which can be difficult to see from the code. Some people like this, some people don't. Either way, in D it is worse (better?) due to things like opDispatch, @property, opApply, lazy which have the potential to change innocent looking code into things that you don't expect.  I don't think this is a big issue personally, but some might find this off-putting.  D requires garbage-collection  This could be seen as controversial because it is possible to run D without the GC. However, just because it is possible doesn't mean it is practical. Without a GC, you lose a lot of D's features, and using the standard library would be like walking in a minefield (who knows which functions allocate memory?). Personally, I think it is totally impractical to use D without a GC, and if you aren't a fan of GCs (like I am) then this can be quite off-putting.  Naive array definitions in D allocate memory  This is a pet peeve of mine:  int[3] a = [1, 2, 3]; // in D, this allocates then copies  int a[3] = {1, 2, 3}; // in C++, this doesn't allocate    Apparently, to avoid the allocation in D, you must do:  static const int[3] staticA = [1, 2, 3]; // in data segment  int[3] a = staticA; // non-allocating copy    These little 'behind your back' allocations are good examples of my previous two points.  Edit: Note that this is a known issue that is being worked on.  Edit: This is now fixed. No allocation takes place.  Conclusion  I've focussed on the negatives of D vs C++ because that's what the question asked, but please don't see this post as a statement that C++ is better than D. I could easily make a larger post of places where D is better than C++. It's up to you to make the decision of which one to use.

Consider, OTOH, the fact that I've never even seen a wood mouthpiece.  There are many different styles and types of rubber/plastic ones, and some clarinetists swear by the crystal models (and saxophonists looking for giant sound use Otto Link metal mouthpieces).  Just pointing out that sometimes there are tradeoffs made in the interest of reliability as well as sound quality.  BTW, I used to play a metal clarinet in marching bands.  It sounded crappy but I suspect a properly designed and built model would sound fine, albeit more saxophonish.    For that matter, solid metal 'brass' instruments tend to sound better than their fiberglass brethren.  It's just a lot less painful to march with a lightweight Sousaphone, and the delta sound quality doesn't matter a whole lot in a football stadium.

softwareengineering.stackexchange,120355,Is it better to return NULL or empty values from functions/methods where the return value is not present?,"StackOverflow has a good discussion about this exact topic in this Q&A. In the top rated question, kronoz notes:    Returning null is usually the best idea if you intend to indicate that    no data is available.  An empty object implies data has been returned, whereas returning null    clearly indicates that nothing has been returned.  Additionally, returning a null will result in a null exception if you    attempt to access members in the object, which can be useful for    highlighting buggy code - attempting to access a member of nothing    makes no sense. Accessing members of an empty object will not fail    meaning bugs can go undiscovered.    Personally, I like to return empty strings for functions that return strings to minimize the amount of error handling that needs to be put in place. However, you'll need to make sure that the group that your working with will follow the same convention - otherwise the benefits of this decision won't be achieved.  However, as the poster in the SO answer noted, nulls should probably be returned if an object is expected so that there is no doubt about whether data is being returned.  In the end, there's no single best way of doing things. Building a team consensus will ultimately drive your team's best practices.

music.stackexchange,23947,What is the difference between Overdrive and Distortion?,"From a sound design / sound engineer context  As an effect, distortion is any process that alters the sound in the harmonic (tone, timbre) domain.   Overdrive is a type of distortion. It is achieved by saturating (overdriving) the valves in an amplifier (or a simulation of this dynamic).   In that context, overdrive is a subset of distortion.  From a guitar effect / pedal context  From this page:    So what is the difference between a distortion and an overdrive? To put it simply, an overdrive pedal aims at simulating the creamy sound of an overdriven tube amp whereas a distortion does not try to simulate reality and usually offers more gain and is more aggressive.    From the Wikipedia distortion page:    The terms ""distortion"", ""overdrive"" and ""fuzz"" are often used interchangeably, but they have subtle differences in meaning. Overdrive effects are the mildest of the three, producing ""warm"" overtones at quieter volumes and harsher distortion as gain is increased. A ""distortion"" effect produces approximately the same amount of distortion at any volume, and its sound alterations are much more pronounced and intense. A fuzzbox (or ""fuzz box”) alters an audio signal until it is nearly a square wave and adds complex overtones by way of a frequency multiplier.    What is the difference in tone, harmonics, etc.? Are they the same? Which one is better and for what?  The difference is in the distortion amount. Overdrive generates less amount of tone change than distortion. Distortion generates more harmonics and/or the generated harmonics will have more amplitude than overdrive.  Overdrive will be better if you want a cleaner sound, and distortion will be better if you want a more distorted sound.   We can test this by applying both effects to a sine wave and comparing the results. For these tests, I'll use the highest amount of effect possible for each device.  These pics show the device's settings, followed by the harmonic content it induced in the sine wave.

These primarily have to do with the quality of the journal: so long as it is a reputable, peer-reviewed journal, I wouldn't be too concerned with the ""strength"" of the work.  The reason is that publishing while an undergraduate—particularly as a primary author—demonstrates that you have already started to learn the basics of how to do research in your field. This means that you're less of an ""unknown"" quantity, and therefore less of a risk for a department reviewing your application. If you don't publish the research, then there's no tangible proof, and then you need to rely on your research supervisor to make that point in a letter of recommendation.

cooking.stackexchange,11094,Differences between cooking a whole duck vs chicken or turkey?,"With chicken and turkey, the most important ""trick"" to cooking it is to make sure the dark meat gets done before the white meat dries out, and to make sure the skin crisps up somewhat.  Duck is all dark meat, and has a thick layer of fat that must be rendered out. There is not a lot of danger in drying out the breast meat like with a chicken.  Like Martha said, it's best to make a few shallow cuts in the skin over the breast (don't go all the way through to the meat) to help the fat render out. A simple (western) roasted bird would be cooked at 350°F for about 1 hour 45 min, with the oven turned up to 500°F for another 15 minutes to crisp up the skin. There is a LOT of fat rendered out, so it's best to roast in a sturdy roasting pan, on a rack (so it doesn't sit in the fat), and drain the fat about an hour into cooking (save the fat, though; it's delicious).

cs.stackexchange,6125,When would best first search be worse than breadth first search?,"Best first search is different from BFS and DFS by that that it uses problem specific information to chose which node of the search tree to expand next. Best first search is informed search and DFS and BFS are uninformed searches.  In order to use informed search algorithm you need to represent the knowledge of the problem as heuristic function.  Best first search is sometimes another name for Greedy Best First Search, but it may also mean class of search algorithms, that chose to expand the most promising node based on an evaluation function(not necessary the same as the heuristics) such as Greedy Best First Search, A* and others.    If you meant Greedy Best First Search:    it is complete (finds a solution in finite graphs) like BFS  it is not optimal(to find the least cost solution) as DFS, but BFS is optimal when the cost of each arc is the same  in the worst case its time and space complexity is O($b^n$), where b is the branching factor and n is the maximal depth. For BFS time and space complexity is O($b^m$), where m is the depth of the shallowest goal.  Greedy best-first search is in most cases better than BFS- it depends on the heuristic function and the structure of the problem.

softwareengineering.stackexchange,53468,WPF vs. WinForms - a Delphi programmer's perspective?,"If you have a Delphi background, you will be disappointed in WinForms. You will try to do things that were easy in the VCL, only to find that they're painfully difficult, or even impossible. WPF will be much less confining.  For example, here are just a few of the WinForms limitations we've run into:    WinForms has nothing that compares to TAction, so if you're used to coding with actions, sharing the same text and icon between a menu item and a toolbar button and a right-click menu, centralizing your enabling logic, and updating the enabled state in the background with OnUpdate... you'll hate WinForms, where you have to do all that the hard and error-prone way.  WinForms' old (.NET 1.0 vintage) MainMenu doesn't support images next to menu items, and the new (introduced in .NET 2.0) MenuStrip is riddled with bugs that Microsoft refuses to fix (because the bugfixes might break backward compatibility).  Many controls, e.g. the TreeView, are woefully underfeatured compared to their VCL counterparts (painfully slow, no owner draw, many customization options missing, etc.)  There's nothing resembling the vibrant community of third-party control developers that you're used to in Delphi. There are quality control libraries out there, but you pay for them -- free offerings like VirtualTreeView just aren't out there for WinForms.    WPF is a little more bare-bones in some respects than WinForms, but it's immensely more extensible.    You want something like TAction? WPF has ICommand, which is just as rich as you're used to (but make sure you read Josh Smith's MVVM article -- normally you have to enable/disable your commands manually when the state changes, but his version automatically fires your enabling code in the background like you're used to with OnUpdate).  You want images on menus? That's built in (and nowhere near as buggy as in WinForms).  WinForms leaves out owner-draw on some important controls, but if you're using WPF instead, you don't need owner-draw -- if you want your TreeView nodes to have black text followed by a blue number in parentheses, you just put it in your DataTemplate and it works, no ugly owner-draw code needed.  You want third-party controls? In many cases, you don't need them, because you can extend what's there in ways WinForms and, yes, VCL developers can only dream about.    WPF has a very steep learning curve, but if you pick up a good book (e.g. ""WPF 4 Unleashed""), it'll help get you over the worst of it -- and you'll be glad to work with a framework that won't hold you back the way WinForms will.

Sure, you can make some overall opinions about narrowbody (one aisle) vs widebody (two aisles) but not much else. Power, inflight entertainment, and even just the upholstery are all going to matter as much as layout.  If I was travelling alone on AirCanada, I would go with the 330 because two of the three banks of rows have no ""middle seat"". If I was travelling as a family of three, that same difference would cause me to reject the 330. I guess maybe a family of four would prefer the 330 since you could get two rows of two and have two windows and a little family cluster.

music.stackexchange,1338,Guitar practice: more often but less time or once in a few days but for a few hours?,"  What's better: pick up a guitar every day for a few minutes or play more rarely, but having a longer session?    Neither. It's not length of time, but what you do with it when you have it. If you spend your time playing the same three songs over and over again, you'll not likely improve save to be able to play three songs endlessly. That's a simplification, but it serves to illustrate a point.  If you're not spending your time working on things that you have trouble with, or working with tools and methods that help you improve, whether you do it for 10 minutes or 10 hours doesn't really matter.  Lets say you have an hour to dedicate to practicing (as opposed to just playing) your instrument, here is how I would suggest you break it down:    5m - warm up, stretching exercises  10m - modes, scale runs (try to work in things like string skipping)  15m - chords, inversions, arpeggios  15m - sight reading (I'll pick a new chart from the Real Book)  10m - general wanking  5m - musical meditation (listen to something new, play blindfolded...something to connect the soul to the music)    Always with a metronome all of it.

travel.stackexchange,3927,Is it cheaper to get to Cuba from Miami or Cancún?,"Be aware that for the most part, you can't go from the US to Cuba, unless specifically authorized by the government.  Most people go to Canada or Mexico and fly from there.  From Wikitravel:    Jose Martí International Airport outside Havana is the main gateway    and is served by major airlines from points in Canada, Mexico, and    Europe. There are also regional flights from other Caribbean islands.    Cuba's national carrier is Cubana de Aviacion, connecting the island    to a handful of destinations in Mexico, South and Central America,    Canada and Europe.  Flights from Miami to Cuba are offered to authorized American    passengers. Try calling Cuba Travel Services (CTS Charters). They    offer daily non-stop flights between Los Angeles and Miami to Cuba.  There are also regular holiday charter flights to resorts such as    Varadero, and these can sometimes be less expensive than those going    to Havana.  Please note that if you have purchased a oneworld ticket then further    flights into America within that year will be disallowed through    American Airlines.    As for what is the cheapest, that's hard to answer as airlines change their prices and can't be answered objectively and accurately as they're subject to change.  In addition, it’s not possible to search for flights on large booking engines (such as Kayak) due to United States travel restrictions. As a result, you need to be creative: use European booking engines or go directly to the airlines’ websites. On a large European booking engine (Skyscanner) you can find flights from Cancun to Havana on combinations of Cubana and/or AeroMexico flights,.

cs.stackexchange,12067,"Realtime hardware/software versus PC software/hardware, how are these distinct and alike?","In general, the difference between ""normal"" and ""real-time"" is some sort of guarantee on the time it takes to complete job. In a normal system, usually you have no guarantees at all. Programs can get interrupted by other programs, the OS scheduler might not be completely fair, the processor does complicated things that alter the runtime between executions of the same code...  For most applications this does not matter.  Real-time systems are built such that one can guarantee that job X is always completed after at most Y seconds. This is important for example for the chip that decides when to deploy air bags--if that takes longer than expected, you're dead. To be able to give these guarantees you have to use special operating systems (or no operating system at all) that guarantees appropriate scheduling. It is also necessary to know a lot of details about the hardware you're using. Does your chip have a cache? What kind of replacement policy does it use? How many cycles does an addition take? Is that always the same number? What's the branch prediction algorithm? etc.  Many people confuse real-time systems with very powerful processors that can churn through data ""in real time"". But that's not (always) the case. The important thing is not how long it takes in absolute time, the important part is that it never takes longer than expected. There are trade-offs both in hard- and software between throughput (expected computation speed) and predictability (worst-case speed).

travel.stackexchange,5408,Why is a nonstop flight sometimes more expensive than multiple connections?,"I think the answer has to do with competition.  If you want to fly from Madrid to Rio de Janeiro with one stop, you have lots of options.  You can fly TAM (via Sao Paulo), TAP Portugal (via Lisbon), American (via New York or Miami), KLM (via Amsterdam), Air France (via Paris), etc, etc.  (I found these with Kayak.)  There is a lot of competition and this will tend to drive fares down.  However, if you want to fly from Madrid to Sao Paulo nonstop, your only choices are TAM, Iberia, and (somewhat surprisingly) Air China (though only twice a week).  There is less competition, so fares may tend to be higher, and this may exceed the effect of the cost of the extra flight GRU-GIG.  As a more exaggerated example, from my home airport of Ithaca (ITH), I've often seen ITH-EWR-SFO (a total of 4400 km) priced lower than ITH-EWR (which is only 275 km).  There are three different airlines providing one-stop service ITH-xxx-SFO, but only one that flies ITH-EWR nonstop.

superuser.stackexchange,40216,What has more impact on performance: Readyboost or paging file on a system with 2GB RAM?,"Regarding page files, Mark Russinovich (pretty much the expert on Windows in everyway) wrote an article that can be found here: [REF]    He finds that turning the pagefile off is a huge mistake. The key quote is probably:    Perhaps one of the most commonly asked    questions related to virtual memory    is, how big should I make the paging    file? There’s no end of ridiculous    advice out on the web and in the    newsstand magazines that cover    Windows, and even Microsoft has    published misleading recommendations.    Almost all the suggestions are based    on multiplying RAM size by some    factor, with common values being 1.2,    1.5 and 2. Now that you understand the role that the paging file plays in    defining a system’s commit limit and    how processes contribute to the commit    charge, you’re well positioned to see    how useless such formulas truly are.  Since the commit limit sets an upper    bound on how much private and    pagefile-backed virtual memory can be    allocated concurrently by running    processes, the only way to reasonably    size the paging file is to know the    maximum total commit charge for the    programs you like to have running at    the same time. If the commit limit is    smaller than that number, your    programs won’t be able to allocate the    virtual memory they want and will fail    to run properly.  So how do you know how much commit    charge your workloads require? You    might have noticed in the screenshots    that Windows tracks that number and    Process Explorer shows it: Peak Commit    Charge. To optimally size your paging    file you should start all the    applications you run at the same time,    load typical data sets, and then note    the commit charge peak (or look at    this value after a period of time    where you know maximum load was    attained). Set the paging file minimum    to be that value minus the amount of    RAM in your system (if the value is    negative, pick a minimum size to    permit the kind of crash dump you are    configured for). If you want to have    some breathing room for potentially    large commit demands, set the maximum    to double that number.

music.stackexchange,22065,Advantages/Disadvantages of a line out compared to a close mic system,"The biggest advantage for line out is that you don't have to worry about feedback, and that you can model the tone without worrying about positioning, angles, mics, bleeding, etc; which is a disadvantage of the mic-amp combo, you need to worry about a lot of things to be able to do it correctly.  If you love the sound that comes out of the speakers of the amp, then microphoning the amp has the advantage of capturing the complete tone of the system.  The two deciding factors often are:     Which sound do you like the most, mic-amp or line out?   If you like the mic-amp sound better, will you be able to implement it correctly and successfully? This means no feedbacks, and being able to capture the tone accurately, and making the guitar sound clear in the mix. This also means that you know how to mic an amp: Which mic will you use? In which angle? Pointing to which part of the amp? How close to the amp? You also need to know about feedback, how it's generated, how to avoid it (which also means that you know about PA, monitor, and other sound sources positioning).    The biggest difference between both approaches is the tone. One sounds different than the other. The best guitar amps sound beautiful as a whole (including the speakers) and it's more often than not worth putting a mic on them, but this is not the case for all amps.  So, before anything else, find out which sound you like more with the amps and mics you have available.  Since this has such a big impact in the tone, the guitarist is (normally and ideally) who makes that decision, and if for some reason you can't do what he wants, you do the other option. Seems that you are being able to make that decision, but make sure you take the opinion of the guitarist into consideration. His preference will be reflected in the performance, he will perform better under the conditions he likes the most.  If you liked line out more, just send the out to the mixer (through a DI box and the snake, or directly, depends on your setup).   If you liked the mic sound more, you still have some things to do.   The biggest disadvantage of microphoning an amp live is the danger of generating feedbacks.  You need to be very careful with:     Positioning of both the amp and the mic. Both as isolated as you can from other sound sources (PA, monitoring, other amps). Mic pointing to the amp and away from other sound sources.  Mic type. You need a directional mic (cardioid, supercardioid, hypercardioid) that will reject sound that doesn't come from its front (where the amp is).    Check if you can do these. If you can't, go with line out instead. If the mic will be feedbacking, the mic is just not worth it.  Now check if you can implement the amp microphoning correctly. You will check this during the sound check. Now the whole ensemble will be playing, which will test the positioning of your mic and amp. The mic will now capture other stuff.  Can you hear the guitar clearly in the mix? Maybe there is too much going on acoustically around the mic, and it is affecting the tone (even if there is no feedback). Maybe some things are bleeding into the mic too intensely, and you won't be able to add the guitar comfortably to the mix without affecting other elements. Also, it's easier to generate feedback now than ever. You might be able to solve feedback issues here by EQing the frequencies that are giving problems.  Can the guitar be heard in the mix clearly, without feedback issues, and without negatively affecting other elements in the mix? Then go for it! Otherwise, microphoning an amp will have a negative impact in the performance and sound.   It's not a trivial task, but it's worth the try if you really like the sound of the amp-mic combo. You can always just go line out if you can't pull it off, the important thing is to test first.

softwareengineering.stackexchange,111938,Which is a better practice - helper methods as instance or static?,"This really depends. If the values your helpers operate on are primitives, then static methods are a good choice, as Péter pointed out.  If they are complex, then SOLID applies, more specifically the S, the I and the D.  Example:  class CookieJar {        function takeCookies(count:Int):Array<Cookie> { ... }        function countCookies():Int { ... }        function ressuplyCookies(cookies:Array<Cookie>        ... // lot of stuff we don't care about now  }    class CookieFan {        function getHunger():Float;        function eatCookies(cookies:Array<Cookie>):Smile { ... }  }    class OurHouse {        var jake:CookieFan;        var jane:CookieFan;        var cookies:CookieJar;        function makeEveryBodyAsHappyAsPossible():Void {             //perform a lot of operations on jake, jane and the cookies        }        public function cookieTime():Void {             makeEveryBodyAsHappyAsPossible();        }  }    This would be about your problem. You can make makeEveryBodyAsHappyAsPossible a static method, that will take in the necessary parameters. Another option is:  interface CookieDistributor {      function distributeCookies(to:Array<CookieFan>):Array<Smile>;  }  class HappynessMaximizingDistributor implements CookieDistributor {      var jar:CookieJar;      function distributeCookies(to:Array<CookieFan>):Array<Smile> {           //put the logic of makeEveryBodyAsHappyAsPossible here      }  }  //and make a change here  class OurHouse {        var jake:CookieFan;        var jane:CookieFan;        var cookies:CookieDistributor;          public function cookieTime():Void {             cookies.distributeCookies([jake, jane]);        }  }    Now OurHouse need not know about the intricacies of cookie distribution rules. It must only now an object, which implements a rule. The implementation is abstracted away into an object, who's sole responsibility is to apply the rule. This object can be tested in isolation. OurHouse can be tested with using a mere mock of the CookieDistributor. And you can easily decide to change cookie distribution rules.  However, take care that you don't overdo it. For example having a complex system of 30 classes act as the implementation of CookieDistributor, where each class merely fulfills a tiny task, doesn't really make sense. My interpretation of the SRP is that it doesn't only dictate that each class may only have one responsibility, but also that a single responsibility should be carried out by a single class.  In the case of primitives or objects you use like primitives (for example objects representing points in space, matrices or something), static helper classes make a lot of sense. If you have the choice, and it really makes sense, then you might actually consider adding a method to the class representing the data, e.g. it's sensible for a Point to have an add method. Again, don't overdo it.  So depending on your problem, there are different ways to go about it.

travel.stackexchange,6951,Pros and Cons of a tent on the ground and its alternatives in Namibia,"I would not sleep on the back of your car. You seem to have a single cab. Then the back should be long enough to sleep on. However, the back will become quite dusty. You will be mainly driving on pads, and dispersed dust will lay down on the back.   In your case I would choose between the rooftop tent and the ground tent. The advantage of the rooftop tent is that you rent on site and you leave it there. If you take your own tent, you will have to fit it into your luggage. Maybe you will have to pay an extra allowance for taking it. Thus, if taking the own tent option seems interesting from a financial point of view, don't forget this point.   The disadvantage of the rooftop tent is that you will have to mount and demount it several times a day: demount it in the morning if you do an excursion, mount it again to have a siesta, demount for the evening drive and mount to sleep.    The camping grounds are guarded and very often also fenced (as e.g. in Etosha). The bigger animals are thus kept out.   I would not be bothered about hyenas. Baboons are much more scary. They are clever, insolent and sometimes even aggressive. They are skilled climbers and a rooftop tent won't deter them. Even smaller monkeys, like the vervet monkey, can be a major annoyance.

academia.stackexchange,26950,Are two undergraduate degrees better than one master degree?,"Disclaimer: the following is my practical experience on research. I have no idea about the opinions of admissions committees and the like, but it probably depends greatly on the country and the relative quality of master's and undergrad education.  I am a theoretical physicist by formation (5 years degree). Then I did my master's thesis (I had taken enough courses) in Bioinformatics, and I am doing a PhD in Biophysics.  When I start a new project (or tackle the next sub-project), there are a bunch of things about Biology and Chemistry that I don't know, but most of them are actually quite easy. I am sometimes lacking ""the bigger picture"", being able to my questions into a broader meaning, but that is not so important. For example, my master's project was to improve the number of identified peptides in an experiment using computational techniques, and that is a very clear goal. What to do with this improved results? Obviously, we can improve the things we already do. But, are there biological questions it can help answer? I am not sure, but there are experts on that.  For the middle picture range, I rely on my advisors. They are also physicists, but they have learned along the way pretty much what they need. And after just a few months, I was surprised of how much I was able to help the new members of the lab.  Actually, I believe taking another undergrad degree would not help so much. Of course, I would be faster at the beginning, because I would know what things like ""the $C_\alpha$ residuals"" mean, but the actual meat of the project, where we spend months, is probably not covered (or not covered in enough detail) in most undergrad degrees. And the main reason is that these details are known only to those who have actually worked hands on with it.  Let me give you an example: in Physics we talk about spectra all the time, and all the information you can extract from it, with perhaps, the only limitation is the noise of your instrument. The truth is, unless you have a VERY expensive camera, you are going to find very funny stuff, like two spectra taken right after the other, with exactly the same experimental set up, will not have, on camera, the same intensity; and even the profile of the line. To compensate for this you need to get clever, and it very much depends on the details, so it is very difficult to teach unless your lecturer is an expert in spectra analysis and can tell you how they do it. And still, most people can just rely on the spectra pre-processed by the experts, so they don't need to know this. Unless, of course, you want to work with raw spectra yourself (been there).    Lastly, a master's or a PhD has some courses. They are usually quite specialised, targeted for your level and background, and can bring you up to speed in the things you need to know about your field quite nicely.  And to add some peace of mind, my former lab hired a postdoc coming from computer vision. His biological knowledge had quite big holes, but nevertheless, in a couple of weeks he was already doing amazing stuff with very good ideas.  Bottomline, go for the advanced studies. You can always take Biology or Economy on the side (for example Open University or unofficially at Coursera).

My tap water, for example, is from the public system and is considered 'hard' because it has a high mineral (calcium and/or magnesium) content.  If I use tap water consistently on certain plants, I can see white rings of calcium deposits sitting on the soil surface; this can change the chemical properties - such as the pH - of the soil which can affect plant growth. Softened water has higher levels of salt than plants prefer, and these salts can build up in the soil. I've never seen the chlorine in public water causing any ill effects on my plants, but if you have sensitive house-plants you can let chlorine-treated water sit out for 24 hours to let the chlorine evaporate.

cooking.stackexchange,316,"When baking, is it better to use a gas or electric oven?","For baking cakes and breads it is important to control the humidity in the oven. In early stages of baking one typically needs the humidity to remain in the baking chamber, which is hard to do with a gas oven.  Two of the bakeries near my house use electric ovens with brick lined baking chambers; the other uses gas.   Expansion  Gas and electric ovens can be built to bake the same way if cost is not an issue.  Most home gas ovens will circulate the combustion products (mainly water vapor and carbon dioxide) in the cooking chamber.  As the flames burn, combustion products need to be vented out of the baking chamber.  Electric ovens also need vents in the baking chamber to help maintain the pressure as the air inside expands.  Steam is essential in the initial stages of baking for good crust formation in breads and crack-free cake surfaces. The oven cavity can hold much more steam than released from the gas combustion and it is my inference that the steam content of an electric oven will be higher  (I cannot find published steam measurements inside ovens). After the dough expansion, the vapor coming off of the dough or batter needs to removed quickly for browning and for the inside to cook well.  The constant flow in a gas oven makes it better at that. In an electric oven a peep or two during the last baking stages will handle excess moisture.    Two bakeries near my house use electric ovens, the other, which makes excellent French baguettes, uses a gas oven.  The baker there has had both electric and gas ovens and he prefers the caramelization of the gas oven.  But note that he can handle the moisture problem with the steam injector of his professional gas oven.  He also noted that using gas ovens require skill as they have temperature and moisture quirks.    Recipes may be adapted to either gas or electric ovens.

If the non-English venue is a community that will be valuable for you to connect with, then publishing there can be extremely helpful with building professional contacts, getting into a good Ph.D. program or getting a good job, etc.  Note that this may apply even if you're planning to study abroad later, as those colleagues may have overseas contacts.  On the other hand, sometimes you are less interested in the interactions at the conference than in just having a ""this is published"" stamp and collecting citations for another line in your C.V.  In this case, it's not the conference itself but the online accessibility of the paper that's likely to be matter more to you, and it will likely to be more valuable to have it in English if your subfield is (like most currently are) English-dominated.

The input quality of Sogou IMO is still second to none, but after these years, Sogou has got even more bloat.   Google Pinyin hasn't been updated since 2014. It is virtually dead.   The Windows 10 stock IME, Microsoft Pinyin, is probably a good bet, it is quite lean even compared with its predecessors, plus you don't have to install anything.   Some people vouch on 中州韵. It's an Open Source solution. Besides pinyin, it also supports a world of input solutions. I've tried it some time ago and it may have some quirks, but you get a totally free IME - How cool is that!  Below are the old answer. Some of it no longer holds but oh well.  --  Never ever use the default Windows IMEs for inputting Simplified Chinese text, they totally suck.  Sogou Pinyin is the father of all modern Chinese IMEs. It has the largest market share in China. It has a hell of a feature set, but current versions included lots of useless bells and whistles (Who the heck needs a custom theme for an IME?), of course you can disable them, but you have to dig into the settings menus.  Google Pinyin is an excellent IME. It copied many ideas from Sogou, even stealed the word and phrase database for once, but it has been improved for quite a bit. Due to the awkwardness of Google's position in China, it doesn't have much market share here, except for some die-hard google fans.   QQ Pinyin is another one on the rise. It is the last one joined into the competition, and I'd say it copied many ideas from Sogou as well, but its market share is drastically increasing due to the popularity QQ (the IM) in China.   The features of the 3 IMEs are quite similar. You wouldn't have problems switching from one to another, by far I still like Sogou most.  If you want a solution from Microsoft, try MSPY 2010. It originally came out with the release of Office 2010, and now you can get it as a separate download. It's not as cool as the other three. The only advantage you get is the hit rate of long sentence input. As saf123 mentioned, it's probably the only IME which doesn't gather user information.  And finally, the google trend chart:    The blue one is Sogou, of course.  All of the above IMEs support the input of Traditional Chinese texts, but since they all use GBK charset, if you are accustomed to the Big5 charset, i.e., you are from Hong Kong or Taiwan, some of the characters might come out a bit strange to you.

Microsoft were extremely late in adopting MVC so they are now pushing hard to fill the blanks.  Also note that I'm not suggesting that event-driven is bad and mvc is good. Both architectures have their valid uses and distinct merits. What was pretty bad, was that up until recently there wasn't an easy way to implement mvc on ASP.NET so people would have to get extra creative with the event driven approach in cases where mvc would be more appropriate.

music.stackexchange,3044,"What are the pros/cons of the ""tuning-in-slide"" method of trombone design?","Actually, American manufacturers (notably Conn and Olds) produced slide-tuning instruments well into the 1960s.  The design lasted longest in bass trombones (the Olds P24 and Conn 7xH).  S. E. Shires currently produces a slide-tuning alto and makes slide-tuning slides for tenors and basses on special order.  Kanstul makes a slide-tuning bass in its 1662 series and 1670 series, and a slide-tuning tenor in its 1688/1608 series.  Slide tuning has a substantial advantage for bass trombones because it allows a longer continuously tapered bell section.  Trombones are roughly 1/3 tapered and 2/3 cylindrical tubing.  A Bb/F bass trombone with slide tuning (and NO provision for bell tuning) can have a tapered tubing proportions that are approximately correct for the F side.  Of course, then it's too long for the Bb horn.  Slide tuning also allows for a longer slide section.  The Conn 62 has an in-tune low C without worrying about going off the inner slides.  Other instruments (notably the Bach 50) have the low C (on the F side alone) perilously near the end of the slide.  Shires went to slide tuning on his alto so that the instrument would have solid low A and E.  Other altos are notorious for having these notes almost off the slide.  Slide-tuning has two primary disadvantages.  First is weight: including the tuning mechanism in the slide necessarily increases the outer slide's weight.  More weight means more inertia means a slower slide.  Modern designs have much lower weight penalties than the designs of the 1960s.  The other problem is slide alignment.  A slide tuning instrument has more moving parts, which theoretically make it vulnerable to alignment problems.  As with all things musical, it is a matter of paying your money and taking your choice. Slide tuning and bell tuning trombones have different timbral and playing characteristics. Having a conical bell section generally gives a warmer sound than that of a bell tuning instrument. However, the conical bell section is very open and may require more air and effort from the player at louder dynamics.

travel.stackexchange,3543,Car rental in Sydney - airport or town?,"Most reputable car hire companies will let you pick up from the airport, although I'm not exactly sure where the pickup point is as I live in Sydney and have never needed to do this.  It is absolutely unnecessary to head into the city center from the airport, so just forget about that.  From the airport you're pretty much heading in the opposite direction from the traffic flow to the city if you are heading west towards Orange, so the likely (not promising) situation is light traffic. You'll be traveling out west on the M5 whereas any morning traffic will be heading east towards the city.  Just be careful not to miss the right hand turn onto the M5, the light set up at the end of Marsh street is a bit dodgy, but once you're on and into the tunnel just keeping heading along the M5.

The drawback is that you have to commit to an itinerary in advance. A pass gives you much more flexibility. Also note that if you are using a pass, you have to pays extra fees for compulsory seat reservations. You can find an overview of the tariffs on the ""Train Seat Reservations"" page of eurail.com.    Now you see that the definitive answer depends on you and your plan. You can easily check the prices and book the tickets via the following websites:    TGV-europe, for train travel in France, as well as between England and France and Italy and France. Don't be misled by the name of the site. It is not confined to TGV trains only.   Trenitalia, for train travel in Italy and between Italy and France.  The Man in Seat 61 for train travel in England.    I have quickly done the exercise for a hypothetical trip in May. I managed to find all the individual tickets for around 160 EUR if you travel in the 2nd class. Note that you will have to book as soon as possible and that you will certainly have to incur fees if you change your itinerary afterwards. The Eurail pass costs 228 EUR if you are less than 26 years old or 348 EUR if you are older. Add to these prices the reservation fees. Note that the ""Adult"" (26+) Eurail pass entitles you to travel in the first class. If flexibility and 1st class comfort are important, go for the Eurail pass.

academia.stackexchange,57309,Why is there less funding or scholarship opportunity for business students compared to other background students?,"It may be useful to take a slightly larger perspective, rather than comparing just business vs. STEM.  While there is a great degree of variation around the world and from program to program, most higher-level degree funding can be clustered into three general categories:    Doctoral degrees in STEM fields are generally funded by universities or external agencies.  Terminal ""professional"" degrees, including MBA, MD, JD, DDS, etc. frequently expect students to be responsible for their own funding, often going deeply into debt to do so.  Doctoral degrees in humanities and liberal arts fields are in-between, where sometimes students are supported or partially supported and other times they are not.    There's a great deal of variation, of course.  For example, I believe that the education of medical doctors is supported by some nations (though I lack a reference at the moment).  Likewise, Masters degrees are sometimes considered a ""professional degree"" that students are expected to fund, while other times they are lumped in with STEM doctoral degrees and funded by the university or other sources.  So, why should this be the case?  It seems to me that a lot of this is simply independently developing markets:    STEM students are typically expected to contribute significantly to the investigation of science and engineering as part of their training, and since these contributions can be very valuable in those markets, it makes sense for external funding agencies to include students in their funding.  Professional degrees are often coupled with very high post-graduation salaries, while the training period is much more one-way, with the students spending most of their time learning rather than making novel (and readily fundable) contributions.  Humanities and liberal arts are also quite important societally, but they are not currently associated with markets flush with capital and an easy set of incentives to pour money into schools either during the program (as with STEM) or afterward (as with professional degrees).

In this bunch, I am good at sight reading, good at reading notes, can    only memorise with both hands; bad at rhythm, bad at memorising.    One possible explanation among others to your situation:  The memory most people have (and the first to go away when under stress) is finger memory. It comes from playing the piece over and over and doesn't require much understanding of the piece.  If you are good at sight reading, chances are you quickly play hands together and thus acquire that finger memory. And chances are also that you rely on the music sheet heavily (since you read well) and don't have to challenge your memory.   Bad at memorizing can mean many things: that it goes away with stress, that it takes a long time to come to you, etc.  Take a short piece and explore a different approach: practice it diligently with hands separately for a much longer time; try to play it from memory after just a few passes, even if you don't know it yet; then as you start playing it from memory, start randomly from anywhere in the piece, and chances are that you will find yourself having a very strong memorization for that piece, pretty quickly, playing it with both hands or only one hand.

Why do you want to publish at all?  You answered    I write the book to store down my research results and to spread my new knowledge. To make money is not the main aim, but it would be nice.    Given that: the answer is that you should certainly not self-publish your work.  You can store your results and spread knowledge by having the material freely available on the internet, as I believe is already the case.  The arxiv is one nice place to put work, but it is not the only one: you could put in on github or any number of other repositories.  You can just put it on your own website and make sure that google indexes it.  That means that billions of people can access it at any time.  Let me be clear with you: you are not going to make money self-publishing works of mathematics that you have not been able to publish traditionally.

If you go self-publishing rather than traditional publishing, you will lose money, and what you're paying for is the vanity of being a published author.   The bar for interest by the mathematical community is much lower than the bar for the type of public interest needed to generate any real sales.  The thought that you have ""My ideas are too bold for the mathematical community, so I need to take matters into my own hands; they don't know the value of my work as well as I do"" is not only crankish but actually specifically damaging to you: it makes you ideal prey for predators of various kinds.  You told us in a previous question that you literally fell prey to a diploma mill and thereby lost money.  The same mindset that you have now is going to cost you more money in the future.    I'm sorry to tell you this, but this has been going on for several years now, so I feel I should be plain: no one in the world has found your work to be of significant mathematical value.  This means that, with probability slightly less than one, that your work does not have significant mathematical value.  But in the unlikely event that your work does have value, you're not doing what is necessary in order to show it.  Mathematical research is not about simply writing down structures that generalize other structures and proving results about them.  You have to solve old problems or pose new ones that are of interest to the community. Bold statements of superiority would be a positive thing if they are specific and factual: for your work to be ""superior"", it should solve at least one problem that others have posed.  If you've done that, please explain yourself properly and then your work can be published in the mathematical mainstream.  If you haven't: please start to be honest with yourself about the value of your work.  Your livelihood is at stake.

academia.stackexchange,56808,Is it better to repeat a caption or reference an identical caption?,"It depends on several factors:    Can you expect readers to read this part of the caption only once and remember everything important for the rest of the reading? Or do you expect that readers need to constantly consult the caption to understand your figure?  Do you expect figures to be read in order? Or is it likely that a reader will look at a later figure in the series first?  How much information does the caption contain? This is not the same as the first point, as not all of this information needs to be important. Also, this is not exactly about length; a short caption with a lot of numbers is worse than a long caption describing straightforward concepts.  Do you need the space used by the repeated captions?    Positive answers to the respective first questions are in favour of referencing.  But why reference at all, unless you need the space? Because redudancy, in particular in technical aspects is annoying and time-consuming for the reader. If a caption references another caption the reader still remembers, this is the quickest way of communicating it. Otherwise the reader has to read the same (usually boring) text again. Moreover, if there is an unneeded redundancy, I would expect that there is a reason for this, e.g., that you changed some details of what is described in the caption. This would usually make me frantically compare the two caption (and thus flipping back and forth).  If you have the space, I suggest a third way that takes the best of both worlds:    Fig 7. 2×167 in 10–200 mM KCl: (a)–(c) as labeled in Fig. 6, namely: (a) shows the reduced intensity for the varied sample conditions with the inset showing a key region. (b) shows how the scale applied to each data as a function of the concentration. (c) shows the time dependence.    This way, all the information is available for the reader who does not remember or has never read the earlier figure’s caption. But the reader who did, knows that the rest of the caption is redundant.  ",0,,2,to repeat a caption,[],reference an identical caption,"[[794, 805]]"

academia.stackexchange,42990,"Which one is more beneficial, working independently or collaborating with other researchers?","I'm trying to coin a phrase: interior point maximum.  Well, the phrase already exists: it means that the function you are trying to maximize which is defined on some closed, bounded interval [a,b] does not have its maximum value at either a or b but rather at some point c somewhere strictly in between.    Most functions one studies in calculus have interior point maxima, though there are obvious exceptions: especially if the function is increasing its maximum is at b, and if it is decreasing its maximum is at a.  Perhaps this is because the methods of calculus only speak to interior point maxima: the basic observation is that if the function is differentiable, an interior maximum must occur at a stationary point, i.e., for which the instantaneous rate of change is zero.  (Famously, the converse is not true.)  What's the point of this math lesson?  It's this: when we step outside of math class we tend to completely forget about this phenomenon and try to stare off into space and figure out which of the two extreme points, a and b, is better.  But in many real-world situations it is actually pretty obvious that the maximum must be at an interior point.  To me at least, the current question is a case of this.    If you never collaborate, then you never benefit from anyone else's expertise.  In research we almost never do exactly what we want: rather we collect various pieces of what we want to do, and then have to make hard choices about how and when to combine those pieces into published work.  If you can find someone else whose pieces are complementary to your pieces, then you both benefit tremendously form collaboration, because academia (justly) rates complete solutions more than twice as highly as half solutions.  This is, to me, the best argument for collaboration, and it already shows that ""no collaboration"" is not going to be your optimal choice.    Another argument for collaboration, not nearly as good, is that it allows you to increase your multiplicity: in a given year, maybe you can write one paper all by yourself, or maybe you can write one fourth of four papers and put your name on all of them.  In some academic cultures, depending upon how you play it, you will get more credit with the second option.  However, there is no inherent advantage to this -- in other words, there is no added value to those outside your circle of collaborators -- so this is really rather specious.  (But it works, to a certain extent...unfortunately.)  Another legitimate benefit of collaboration is that your collaborators get to know you and know your skills.  I have several collaborators that don't write as many papers as I do and are perhaps not as high-profile in the community as I am.  I wouldn't have thought they were anything special if I hadn't worked with them -- worked with them because they brought to the table key pieces that I could use to advance my work.  Whenever anyone asks me about these people, I say how great they are.  If you always collaborate, then people begin to wonder whether you can in fact write a paper / complete an experiment / do one unit of substantial academic work by yourself.  If you always collaborate with the same people, and especially if they are more senior than you and/or have other papers without you, then a lot of hard-nosed academics [including me] are going to suspect that you are not the brains of the operation and eventually wonder whether you may not have been gifted coauthorship.  The details of this must be entirely field dependent, but I am in a field in which senior people usually don't get added as coauthors unless their intellectual contribution was decisive [in many cases, this means most decisive], so if I see someone with a sequence of strong papers all of which are joint with their eminent thesis advisor and no others, then I really need to hear their thesis advisor describe specifically and cogently the value added by their student.  (In some fields collaboration is not an option, it's a reality.  But this seems to nullify the question: if a = b, you can maximize the function.)  So it seems clear that it's an interior point maximum: it will be best for your research if you collaborate x% of the time for some 0 < x < 100.  As with all interior maxima, one way to figure out x is: take a rough guess as to what you think a good value of x would be, and then explore the nearby space.  Definitely do at least one collaborative work and at least one solo work and then evaluate how they went.  At the risk of ruining my meme, I will say though that in this case the amount of collaboration is less important -- if you make it safely between 0 and 100% -- than the type of collaboration.  As above, you want to choose collaborations that qualitatively augment your work.  You do not want to ""trade papers"" or get involved in projects just to have your name on one more paper.  Definitely make sure that you are bringing something to the table whenever you collaborate: you really don't want people wondering whether you've added anything of value.

There aren't a lot of these available anymore, most of them are power heads with string trimmers attached by default.  Gas Power head with string trimmer. If you need a trimmer anyways this might be the way to go here. You can start with heavy duty line, and if you need more power you can pick up the optional brush cutter attachment that gives you even more cutting ability.

Personally unless you're expecting to do this kind of massive cleanup every single year, I'd go with the string trimmer and get the brush cutter attachment, it's going to be cheaper (you can do that for ~200$ if you go curved shaft on the trimmer) and it will likely meet you needs, although it will be a lot of work upfront.

music.stackexchange,5320,Starting piano - which instrument to choose?,"I'm going to answer the general question so that this is not a shopping reccomendation per se (61 un-weighted key keyboard with lots of features vs. 76 graded ""soft touch"" key keyboard with minimal features).  Arguments for a 61 key, unweighted keyboard (PSR-E423 in your case):    This is simple and easy to play, due to the fact that:    There are less keys, and   The keys are completely unweighted (you do not have to develop finger strength to play this).    It has additional fun features beyond being a simple piano.    I know I enjoyed playing with the recording / layering abilities, which are still present in this model (and probably much more advanced now).  There are pre-built ""beats"" / song rhythms for you to play along with, which is great for practicing new techniques or ad-libbing.    The non-piano voices will likely be of higher quality than they are on the other keyboard you mentioned    In my experience, the keyboards with 76 to 88 weighted keys are more focused on the piano sound.  The piano will sound great, the other voices will usually sound kind of cheesy.      Arguments against the 76 key, graded ""soft touch"" keyboard (NP-31 in your case):    It only has 76 keys (rather than a full 88).  While this is more than the other choice, I don't think it's worth the loss of the other features in your case.  It uses graded ""soft touch"" action (rather than the more natural weighted keys).  Once again, this is falling short of a real upgrade, and probably unnecessary for what you're trying to do.  It's not nearly as versatile as the PSR.  All you really get is a piano sound (and probably some less-than-stellar other voices).    Based on the description of what you're looking to do, I would strongly suggest 61 key keyboard with more features.  You are not trying to be a professional pianist, so you don't need something that's going to be like a real piano.  Overall, I think you will get much more use out of this option than the other.

travel.stackexchange,37364,Any (dis)advantages to homestay in Ealing as opposed to a Zone 2 area in London?,"Time.    I lived in both Zone 2 and Zone 3 in London (4 years on and off, in Putney, Southfields and Colliers Wood).  Generally (as a guy) I felt safe walking most places in London at night, and on public transport.  Zone 2 doesn't feel safer than zone 3, or less safe.  It's more the certain areas that some people might say to avoid (but that's a different topic).  Zone 2 is not generally considered walking distance to Central London, although it might be, if you're closer to Zone 1 - for example, I've walked to Parliament from Earl's Court easily, but from East Putney I would not be particularly keen - it's a good 25 min on the tube!  From Ealing, you've got a decent way on the tube or bus for every trip.  District or Central line, both will take you into town, and it's convenient for trains out west (overground).  But if you're in town and want to 'pop home' to get something for the evening, it's a fair hike.  It'll totally depend where in Zone 2 the other option is.  As seen on the tube map - Zone two covers an awful lot of suburbs, stations and possibilities.  I'd try and find out where it is.    Of course, the other advantage of having a Zone 3 fare pass (eg buy a Zone 1-3 travel card) is that all your other trips to other Zone 3 locations would be essentially 'free'. And it's not that much more per week.    The other thing to consider is if the tube is down, you'll be taking the bus or overground. So if you know where you're studying (I assume that's why you're there) or where you'll be spending much of your time, play around with the TFL route planner and see how long it might take by bus, train, or tube.

academia.stackexchange,4941,Any risks down the line choosing maths vs. stats PhD programme?,"  Provided one can find a supervisor who has the background and research interestes that would allow one to keep extending ones pure mathematical toolbox are there any major risks in going for a PhD in stats?    There's a small risk, but it can be managed.  The first issue is that you need to make the mathematical content of your work very clear, for example by publishing in journals that could be considered both math journals and statistics journals (e.g., IMS journals).  However, if you're interested in math departments I assume you'd be doing that anyway.  The slightly more subtle issue is how mathematicians view statisticians.  There's sometimes a mild prejudice that people in mathematical statistics are overly specialized and outside of the mainstream of mathematics.  For example, it's possible to get a Ph.D. in mathematical statistics while having considerably less breadth of mathematical background than would be considered acceptable for a math grad student.  (Of course, the flip side is that you are expected to know other things instead.)  There's sometimes a fear that a statistician would be unlikely to talk much with other math department members, or might be unwilling or unable to teach anything but statistics.  Plenty of statisticians have found jobs in math departments, so I don't want to be discouraging.  However, I'd recommend focusing on mathematical breadth.  For example, if you work with people in combinatorics or algebra, then it will be clear to everyone why a math department is a natural fit.  If you talk only to statisticians, it will be less clear.  It can still work out even then, but generally when the department either has a thriving statistics group or has decided they really need a statistician (and either way this cuts down on the flexibility of your job search).

academia.stackexchange,18665,What makes a Bachelor's thesis different from Master's and PhD theses?,"The PhD thesis should be on a much higher level than the Honours/Masters thesis, offering a contribution to human knowledge that is of a sufficient level of ""significance"" to warrant publication in a respected journal.  Significance is highly subjective, and you also do not necessarily have to publish to be awarded the PhD (sometimes the peer-review delay means that they come out afterwards, or there may be some intellectual property issues that make it beneficial to refrain from publication). It is awarded based on your supervisors consent and a review of academics in your field. So the ""significance"" would probably be judged by them in terms of how much original work they see as a reasonable expectation at that stage of your development (first 3 years of serious/committed research). Unfortunately it also means that some people who probably do not deserve PhD's are awarded them anyway for fulfilling grunt work for their easy-going supervisors.  It is possible that some Honours/Masters thesis might even be more significant/higher quality than a PhD thesis. Unfortunately, this does not mean that the submission of the thesis will award the degree that they deserve. The university may have a policy to upgrade the student's enrolment if the supervisor senses that such progress is being made. However, it is impossible to upgrade to a PhD without completing Honours and I believe nearly every single university has a policy of a minimum period of enrolment before submission is allowed. A subsequent question that you may have is how to gain a PhD without enrolling in one, which is another level of achievement completely.  As for the difference between Honours/Bachelor and Masters it would depend on your university, but both have no requirement for publication quality research and are usually small tasks/ideas that are not worth the supervisors time to think about alone, or involve a lot of labor. In fact, in my school, many Honours thesis are of a higher level than the Masters, because the smart Honours students will either graduate into the work force or go straight into a PhD. The Masters students are usually those who cannot find a job and are not suited to research. However, I believe some other universities may require a mandatory Masters degree to start the PhD.  You may get a better idea by looking at some titles/abstracts of completed theses. The PhD level will be something like a new method/observation/application whereas the Masters/Honours will be an application specific set of measurements/simulations or even simply a literature review to gauge the needs of future work.

cs.stackexchange,2251,Why is it seemingly easier to resume torrent downloads than browser downloads?,"The bittorrent protocol was designed to transfer large files out-of-order. It divides files in chunks (pieces in bittorrent terminology), and maintains a map of which participant holds which chunks. One of the elementary commands is for one participant to request a chunk from another participant. If a client crashes or disconnects, it can check which chunks it has already downloaded (the base data includes a cryptographic checksum for each chunk) and request only chunks that it does not already have. I think bittorrent includes a command to request part of a chunk, too, but if worst comes to worst only chunks that have not been fully downloaded need to be re-requested.  The HTTP protocol was designed to transfer mainly small files and to be simple to implement. Its most basic command is to download one file with a minimum of fuss. A simple server may only understand one command, to download a file in full. Hence, if the download is interrupted, there is no choice but to download the whole file again. There is a way for a client to request only part of a file (with the Range: header). Not all servers implement it (because it is not a fundamental feature of HTTP). Web browsers typically don't bother with it (because they are primarily designed to download small files: web pages), but all download managers support it (because they are designed to load large files) and will use it if the server accepts.

softwareengineering.stackexchange,137158,Is it better to use assert or IllegalArgumentException for required method parameters?,"BEWARE!   Assertions are removed at runtime unless you explicitly specify to ""enable assertions"" when compiling your code. Java Assertions are not to be used on production code and should be restricted to private methods (see Exception vs Assertion), since private methods are expected to be known and used only by the developers. Also assert will throw AssertionError which extends Error not Exception, and which normally indicates you have a very abnormal error (like ""OutOfMemoryError"" which is hard to recover from, isn't it?) you are not expected to be able to treat.  Remove the ""enable assertions"" flag, and check with a debugger and you'll see that you will not step on the IllegalArgumentException throw call... since this code has not been compiled (again, when ""ea"" is removed)  It is better to use the second construction for public/protected methods, and if you want something that is done in one line of code, there is at least one way that I know of. I personally use the Spring Framework's Assert class that has a few methods for checking arguments and that throw ""IllegalArgumentException"" on failure. Basically, what you do is:  Assert.notNull(obj, ""object was null"");    ... Which will in fact execute exactly the same code you wrote in your second example. There are a few other useful methods such as hasText, hasLength in there.

travel.stackexchange,34890,Why are round-trip car rentals much cheaper than one-way car rentals?,"There are elements of truth in most of the other answers, but as a 16-year veteran of the rental car industry in the US, I'll toss my take into the mix.  Most of the time when you're searching, the answer is: ""because they can.""  What I mean by that is that the whole ""well, someone has to drive it back to the renting office"" is not actually the case. That's because most rental offices in mid-size and larger cities are corporate-owned, and all three of the big-name rental companies that operate the eight major brands (Avis, Budget, Enterprise, Alamo, National, Hertz, Dollar, and Thrifty) now use a ""floating fleet"" model, which means that the companies maintain a nationwide single fleet and any car can be assigned to and rented from any location at any time.  So if someone rents a car at Avis LAX and returns it at Avis in Austin, the car simply gets washed by the detailing crew at Avis Austin, placed in a parking stall at Avis Austin, and assigned to the next Avis Austin customer who comes in to pick up that size car. The same thing happens if they rent at Avis LAX and return at Avis in downtown Los Angeles or Avis in Midtown Manhattan or Avis at Chicago Midway airport. That's why a large number of license plates on any corporate-owned rental lot tend to be from out of state.  Now, of course, for every person who picks up in LAX and returns elsewhere, there's usually someone renting elsewhere and returning in LAX, so the fleet tends to stay pretty balanced. That's why I say they charge the one-way fee ""because they can""--because there really isn't a hard cost to them. Cars go out, cars come in, and all is good. But the market (supply, demand, and competition) allows them to charge a premium price for one-way rentals, so even though there's no (or a very minimal) direct expense associated with these kinds of one-way rentals, they do it because they can.  Of course, sometimes one-way flows do result in an imbalanced fleet. If LAX loses too many cars and they have fewer cars than they forecast needing to meet demand, then they do have to arrange for cars to be brought back from somewhere else. So sometimes it is necessary to truck a load or ten of cars in from elsewhere, and that does have a cost, so collecting one-way fees allows them to cover those costs.  It's worth mentioning that seasonal demand can have some interesting effects. I've taken advantage of the fall ""Florida Drive-In"" specials, where picking a car up in the Northeast and dropping it off in Florida can net some extremely attractive rates ($5-10 per day or so)--cheaper than a standard round-trip rental! This helps the rental car companies move cars from the colder northern states (where demand slacks off in the winter) to the warmer southern states (where winter is peak season). It's much cheaper to have people drive cars down for you than to pay a car carrier to haul it down by truck or, even worse, to have cars sit idle in the north while offices in the south buy or lease extra cars to meet demand. (There's also the related Florida Drive-Out special that takes place in the spring and some less-lucrative similar offerings out west.) So it's not always true that one-way rentals are more expensive!  As well, there are certain places where one-way fees seem to be very reasonable or even not charged. One answer mentioned rentals in Germany--that's a place where one-way fees seem not to be part of the local rental culture, unless you try to drop the car off outside of Germany. Intra-Florida rentals are often quite cheap (due to a ton of competition--it's the largest rental car market in the world and there are literally dozens of rental car companies that operate at Florida's major airports), and intra-California one-ways are frequently not charged fees, too (that's because the one-way flows between places like Los Angeles and San Francisco are pretty balanced--as many people are interested in driving up Highway 1 as are interested in driving down Highway 1, I suppose), so that, combined with the high volume and competition, lends itself to reasonably-priced one-way rentals.  Now, when it comes to franchised locations, one-way fees are based much more in the realities of rental car logistics. If a car owned by a licensee location (typically found at smaller, more rural airports or in some smaller towns) ends up far away from its base, there are hard costs to deal with that situation. The best option is for the receiving location to rent the car back to its owning location on a paid one-way rental, but there's no guarantee of that happening quickly, and the owning location loses the potential revenue of the car they paid for until it gets back into the fleet. Failing that, the owning location has to pay to have the car transported back home, either by car carrier or by sending an employee to go retrieve the car--not a small cost. And in a worst case situation, the least-bad solution is for the owning location to simply sell the car to the receiving location, but that's obviously not without its own costs and logistical headaches.  In these cases with franchised locations, the one-way fees are actually intended to be punitive and dissuade people from choosing that option, but they also cover the rental agency's costs if someone does require a one-way rental.  I should also address a couple of topics with one-way fees. Most rental car agencies now don't quote an explicit, broken-out one-way drop fee, instead baking the one-way fee into the rate itself. For example, a standard round-trip rental in Portland might run you $40 per day, but if you quote a reservation for a one-way to Seattle, it might balloon up to $100 per day. However, some companies, as well as some booking channels (usually prepaid brokers), still break the fee out (for the hypothetical Portland rental, both the round-trip and one-way rentals would price out at $40 per day, but the one-way would have a $100 drop fee attached).  The former model works best for short rentals, while the latter is more advantageous for longer rentals. In the Portland example, if you can do your one-way drive in a single day, the included one-way is cheaper (a net extra charge of $60). But if you're going to take a week to drive the Washington coastline, the weekly rate would balloon from a couple hundred bucks to north of $500. With a separately-itemized $100 drop fee, you'd pay the same fee even if you kept the car for a month. In any case, the best thing to do is just plug your dates and locations into a search engine that searches all rental companies at once and choose the one that displays the cheapest total price (ignore the base rate and pay attention instead to the total with all taxes and fees).  Mileage fees are sometimes charged, but they're more common with franchises. However, sometimes you'll see them applied at major locations depending on what kind of discount code you use. For example, the USAA discount code with Hertz returns very attractive rates even on long-distance one-ways until you notice the catch: an almost punitive mileage fee that can total hundreds of dollars. Unless you're literally just driving across town, mileage-based one-way fees are rarely the best option.

gardening.stackexchange,3419,Do rye or oats make a better winter cover for a poor soil vegetable garden?,"I think the answer depends on more factors than what you've provided in the question -- especially your specific goals, but I can lay out the considerations I would make in choosing between the two.  According to a UVM factsheet, rye can add 5 tons of organic matter per acre. I like rye because the seed is cheap, it germinates quickly and reliably, you can start it late, it catches reliably, it always survives the winter, and it goes like gangbusters when the snow melts in spring. The only real downsides I can think of are (a) it is so vigorous it can be challenging to till under in the spring, and (b) it is allelopathic so you can't sow seeds for a couple of weeks after tilling.  I have less experience with oats -- and none as a winter cover crop, only spring seeded. According to a SARE document, oats can add 1-2 tons per acre with fall seeding. Locally for me, oat seed is less available than rye. Also for me, oats will reliably winter kill, which means it would need to be started earlier in the fall -- but it also would be easier to incorporate in spring. Oats also have allelopathic properties; I think winterkilled oats won't cause problems in the spring. Because of the allelopathy, you should wait 3 weeks (according to SARE) before planting after tilling the oats under.  Either cover crop makes a good nitrogen trap -- ""soaking up"" excess nitrogen left in the soil following the previous main crop and storing it for the following season. They both do a good job of smothering weeds.  The SARE document on oats linked above mentions in ""Comparative Notes"" at the bottom:    [Compared to Oats,] Rye grows more in fall and early spring, absorbs more N and matures faster, but is harder to establish, to kill and to till than oats.     So I guess if you've got a good rototiller and are willing to work at tilling it under in the spring, rye would be my recommendation.

gardening.stackexchange,13701,"Would it be better for me to set up my garden in the fall, or wait until spring?","You could certainly wait until spring and things would probably be fine.  But personally, I'd get going right now with bed preparation.    Till it, clean out the rocks mostly and the weeds and clumps.  The tiller will help break everything into smaller chunks.  To rid yourself of most of those rocks, take a piece of 1/4"" or 1/2"" hardware cloth, nailed to a frame (or not) and use it to separate the rocks from the soil.  I lay the hardware cloth down on a spot in the garden, pick an area of comparable size right next to it and then shovel maybe a couple inches of the topmost soil onto it from that area.  I shake the frame to sift the soil through it and then take the stones and dump them in my wheelbarrow.  Then I put the frame where I just dug and repeat the process, always moving the frame where I just dug and replacing that soil with the newly sifted soil from the next section.  It actually goes by quickly.  If you are in the mood, plant something now and take advantage of the space and the fall weather.  My suggestion?   Bush beans.  They are 50-55 days until harvest generally and so you should be able to get a harvest in before the average first frost date in your area.  I believe you are probably zone 7A like we are here in my neck of the woods.  The beans, by the way, will help the soil by adding nitrogen from the air.  I think the fancy folks call that ""fixing"" the nitrogen.  Regardless, they work well.  Personally, I'd harvest the beans and mow them up right there and let the plants break down in the soil over the winter.  Next, I'd plant a winter cover crop... you could do any number of cover crops like winter rye.  This is a ""green manure"" and it works pretty well.  You just till that stuff into the soil early in the spring before planting.  It adds complexity and organic material your soil - like the bean plants would.  This is, of course, just one way to go.  Come springtime, I'd add compost - your own if you have it.  Vermicompost (worm castings) are great if you have them.  Then, you've got yourself a nice prepared bed and can get things going in the spring without all the bed prep.  Plus, you've got several months of improvement already in place.  Aside:  I generally only till the area the first time and then never bother after that.  I will fork open the soil a bit but I don't run my tiller through it year after year.  I can't see that it really helps things all that much, but that's me.

travel.stackexchange,16300,Is it better to ask a question in English or Japanese if you are expecting a reply in English?,"Asking if someone speaks your language has several potential pitfalls, and even more so in Japan. There are completely different expectations to assess whether oneself actually speaks a language and a portion of fear what kind of expectations the asking person might have if one confirms.  In Japan on top of this, people feel the expectations towards them are much higher than in other countries. while an Italian might hesitate much less to tell you their life story in Italian if you speak only 2-3 words, Japanese have a much higher urge for perfection and rather remain silent as to avoid embarrassment for both of you.  So the best way is normally to try and make the question itself (where is the station?) easiest understandable for the person instead of unintentionally pushing them to a commitment of understanding and being able to reply to you in a foreign language.  So to answer your question, yes they most likely did not want to speak English because, whatever their level of English was, they did not feel that it was enough to confirm that they spoke English.  So if your questions are about a location, knowing the word of that place in Japanese and having a map where people can point to will lead to much better results than asking if they speak English. Asking that in Japanese is even more tricky, specially if your Japanese is not good enough to understand if they would reply in Japanese something along the lines of ""I studied it in school but forgot most of it.""  Regarding getting an answer in Japan to such a question, there is another dimension: People in Japan will not tell you if they do not know the answer. To admit straight away ""I do not know"" is a no-go on several cultural levels in Japan. It would embarrass both of you at the same time from the point of view of the answering person. So unless the person knows the answer, they will most likely start to think silently, tilt their head and make comments like ""So desu nee..."", ""Chotto..."" and pull in air through their teeth. This should be for you the signal not to insist, say thank you and to continue. If you persist, there is a high chance that the person will feel pressured sending you in whatever direction.

cs.stackexchange,45376,Chomsky NF or Greibach NF benefits for LR parser?,"The point of generating a parser (usually) is to parse: ""Analyse (a string or text) into logical syntactic components"" (some online dictionary). That's different from simply recognizing that a text is a member of a language. A given language has a variety of grammars which will recognize its sentences, but typically there is a specific grammar which defines the ""logical syntactic components"" and their relationship to each other, as in the above definition. In real-world applications -- compilers, for example -- one expects an output which is more interesting than simply ""the input is/is not a valid program"".  In some cases, it is possible to recover the original parse tree from the parse tree generated by parsing a transformed grammar. (This is true for CNF, with the usual transformation strategy.) In other cases (such as GNF, as far as I know), it is annoyingly difficult, making such a transformation of limited use for parsing (as opposed to recognition).  Also, not all grammar transformations preserve LR(k)-ness. In particular, the usual CNF transformation involves refactoring of every production into a series of rules with precisely two non-terminals. This often has the effect of converting an LR(1) grammar into a grammar which is not LR(k) for any k. So that's not much help, either.

However, they are cooked slightly differently.  Caramelized onions are usually cross-cut on the onion to release its moisture, and then cooked over very low heat in a crowded pan, stirring infrequently, so that they gradually release their sugars and liquid and it turns to caramel.  Depending on the onions and desired result, you may even cover them, an add a little liquid and/or sugar.  The end result is very soft and very sweet.  Arabic-style crispy onions are cut pole-to-pole in order to avoid rupturing cells in the onions.  They are then fried over medium heat in an uncrowded pan, stirring regularly.  This lets them dry out and become brown and crispy, even burning on thin ends.  These onions should be a mix of crispy and chewy, and more savory than sweet.

softwareengineering.stackexchange,18838,Haskell AND Lisp vs. Haskell OR Lisp,"I suggest learning both, Haskell first, then Common Lisp. My experience with Haskell was that the static typing seemed to be a restricting annoyance at first, but once I got used to it, I noticed that most of my type errors had logic errors hiding behind them. When you get to this point, and the next milestone, which is learning to think in types and define your own types as a means of expressing your solution, you'll be ready for Common Lisp.   With Common Lisp, you can add monads, currying, and everything you liked from Haskell, but you also get multiple inheritance like Frank Shearar mentioned, and generic functions with multiple dispatch, and an advanced exception handling system.   So why not just learn Common Lisp first? Coming from a procedural and OOP background, my experience has been that I didn't really understand functional programming until I had to use it exclusively. Once functional programming is comfortable, you can add the rest of the tools that Common Lisp makes available, and use whatever tool is best at the task at hand.

superuser.stackexchange,9336,What is the difference between Sleep and Hibernate?,"Sleep is commonly known as Standby in Windows systems or S3 in ACPI. In Sleep mode, the power supply to non-essential and non-critical components is withheld, and most system operations are shutdown and stopped. All data in physical memory (RAM) is still kept in internal memory, and the whole system is placed in a standby mode, which can be woken up and used almost immediately.  In Sleep mode, the power load reduces considerably, saving energy. However, the power to the machine must not be cut off completely. If power is lost, the system state will also be lost and the computer will behave as though just booted from a powered-off state.  Hibernate, or S4 in ACPI, meanwhile will save the data in physical memory to the hard disk drive first, and then power off the computer.   In Hibernate mode, a file named hiberfil.sys, which has the same file size as the amount of system memory, will be created on the local disk. When the user restarts the machine, it will boot up and load back the system state at the point of the last hibernation.  The advantage of Hibernation mode is that no power is wasted. In Hibernation, no electricity is consumed by the system so a computer can be kept in this state indefinitely.  Also, restoring from Hibernate is generally faster than a computer reboot. It is also different from a reboot in the sense that users can return to the exact state of the last hibernation with all running programs and open documents intact, instead of booting to an empty desktop.  The disadvantage of Hibernation is that after a period of time, there may be fragmentation of the hiberation file. Users may need to defragment the volume that stores the hibernation file frequently.

academia.stackexchange,55337,"What is the difference between MBA and Masters in a business subject, and which is better for a future researcher?","An MBA is a professional degree designed for students who will go to work in industry and not pursue further graduate study or research.  Students in MBA programs typically all take the same courses in lock step with very few electives or options.  It generally isn't possible to specialize in a particular area in an MBA program.  In that sense, an MBA program is very much like medical school or law school and totally unlike graduate study in engineering and the arts and sciences.   Students in MBA programs usually have several years of full time experience working in low level corporate jobs after completing a bachelors degree.  Because they have had some exposure to the corporate/business world, the courses that they take draw on that experience.     In comparison, the Master's in Management is a professionally oriented degree program aimed primarily at students who have just completed a bachelor's degree.  These programs tend to be more theoretical simply because students have less practical experience to draw on.  Many business schools also offer professionally oriented masters degrees in more specialized technical areas (e.g. a Master's degree in mathematical finance or operations research or analytics.)    PhD programs in business schools are typically very separate from MBA programs and the students in the PhD program will typically take very few if any courses with the MBA students.  PhD students take more theoretical course work, take advanced courses in an area of specialization (e.g. accounting, finance, marketing, etc.) take course work in research methods, and then conduct research and write a dissertation.        If you're just completing a bachelor's degree and want to get a masters and go to work in industry, than a Masters in Management is the typical path.

cooking.stackexchange,20198,What's the functional different between a skillet and a saute pan?,"Skillets are not designed to hold much liquid; as you point out, the curved sides are optimized for easy flipping and turning (i.e. with a spatula). They also normally do not come with lids; I'm sure there are some out there, but even my All-Clad skillets didn't.  You can really only use a skillet for high-heat searing or frying due to their low profile. Don't bother trying to poach or even shallow-fry in one.  Sauté pans, on the other hand, have more height, and usually do come with lids. They're a little heavier, and don't make it as easy to turn, but they can also be used for shallow-frying and moist-heat cooking methods like braising or poaching.  I've seen people make sauce or chili in sauté pans as well; sometimes they're more convenient if you're only going to make a small quantity, since the large exposed surface area (relative to a saucepan) makes it easier to reduce sauces. It's a no-brainer if your recipe starts out with sautéing garlic, onions, vegetables, etc., and then has you adding the liquid ingredients; if you have a large enough sauté pan then you don't need to bother transferring to a saucepan afterward.  I think you've got it backwards; of the two options, a sauté pan is definitely the more versatile option. I use both, but if I only had the space or budget for one, I'd choose the sauté pan, because it can do everything a skillet can do (just not quite as well) and many more things a skillet is useless for. A skillet is really only necessary for people who do a lot of pan-searing.  Note that as commenter Owen suggests, there are ""French skillets"" sold which have higher bases; these are not really skillets, and are not normally sold with lids, but assuming you can find or improvise one, they would make semi-decent multi-taskers.

softwareengineering.stackexchange,98321,How to better start learning programming - with imperative or declarative languages?,"I used to teach Prolog as a first language to freshmen (followed by Scheme and Java in the next semesters) . It was great for some of them, and apparently completely impenetrable for many others. Logic programming may be very close to mathematical logic, but many people are not, in fact very good at formal logic - it's very different from the kind of reasoning (largely informal or even unconscious) that people actually use day-to-day.  On the other hand, I have also taught Java first, with much the same ratio of success! These days I believe that it depends way to much on the individual learner to make a blanket suggestion. I still think that starting with near-machine-level languages (to understand what is actually happening in the computer) and then progressing towards more abstract languages was the right way for me personally, but experience has convinced me that this is not the kind of recommendation that can be generalized.

softwareengineering.stackexchange,100528,New Silverlight app. MVVM. RIA Services vs CSLA,"I have recently been working on some line-of-business Silverlight projects.  For one we used straight WCF and did all the CRUD, state tracking, entity relationship, etc. ourselves.  For the second project we are using RIA Services and had it manage all of that stuff for us.  However, we did NOT have RIA Services directly generate services based on our ORM model.  We had a layer of interfaces and ""dumb objects"" in between.  So we had a distinct data tier, business logic tier, and service tier.  RIA Services was only involved at the service tier.  If you are going to use RIA Services, I recommend limiting how much of the layers of your application you let it influence.  It does force you down certain paths as far as design is concerned, so the more you contain it the more flexibility you will have.  This advice is probably sound for CSLA as well.  If you are going to ""bet"" on a particular framework, hedge your bet as much as possible.  In summary, RIA Services will definitely save you time, but it does limit your flexibility a bit compared with raw WCF.  And it has some kinks and weaker areas that still need improvement.  I haven't worked with CSLA, but I have seen Rocky Lhotka give talks on it several times so I know the basics.  It seems like a solid framework.  However, the main disadvantage it will have compared with RIA Services is that it isn't directly from Microsoft, so CSLA won't mesh as cohesively with other MS stuff as much as RIA Services will.  Also, in the long run I'm guessing it will be easier to find people that know RIA Services versus people that know CSLA.  If it helps, I gave a talk on RIA Services you can find the presentation and some sample code on my blog.

music.stackexchange,20367,What's the difference between alnico and ceramic pickups?,"This may not help a lot, but here is one person's opinion + facts about magnetic cores:  sonicwrench forum    Q: What is the difference between Alnico and ceramic magnets?  A: Alnico magnets are made of an alloy of Aluminum, Nickel, and    Cobalt. Ceramic magnets are made from ferrites (often iron oxides).    Magnetically speaking, ceramic magnets produce a stronger field than    Alnico. The result is a slightly hotter sounding pickup with more    treble response. A lot of people automatically say that Alnico is    superior to ceramic in pickups. Alnico tends to produce a very musical    pickup in most setups. However, there are fantastic sounding ceramic    pickups out there (such as the G&L “MFD” pickups), as well as our own    humbuckers and P90′s. The reason ceramic has a bad rap is probably due    to its use on low quality instruments, in low quality pickups. Ceramic    magnets are often useful in high-output pickups to help retain high    end that is lost due to overwinding, and help to create crunchy    sounding pickups for hard rock, heavy blues, and metal styles.    So like a lot of components in musical instruments, which is ""better"" depends on what you want for sound output.

cooking.stackexchange,25999,What's the difference between pink tea and other types of tea?,"It's hard to know exactly what you're referring to without any context of the event, location, or what you remember it tasting like, so I'll give you my best educated guesses.    If your pink tea sweet and fruity or floral, it was an herbal tea - tisane, and not true tea. (""Tea"" actually refers to the plant whose leaves are used the beverage. Anything that is not made from the tea tree is usually called a tisane.) Some varieties of tisanes that produce a pink liquid include hibiscus, rose petals, rose hips, strawberry.  If the above is not the case, I suspect you're referring to Kashmiri pink tea, sometimes called noon chai.    Disclaimer: I can't find any authoritative sources about Kashmiri online; my knowledge of the subject is anecdotal from my own travels in India as well as stories from people I know who have lived or traveled in South Asia. My understanding is that, like masala chai throughout South Asia, pink tea has some general guidelines but everyone customizes it according to taste or local custom.  The basic distinguishing factors of Kashmiri pink tea compared to a ""regular"" black, green, oolong, or white tea are twofold: color and taste. As you mentioned, this tea is pink in color, which other beverages made from the tea tree are not. The pink color comes from the addition of baking soda. As for taste, pink tea tends to elicit mixed opinions about taste because it is salty; most people around the world typically drink tea unadulterated, or sweetened, but rarely with the addition of salt.  Pink tea shares many ingredients with masala chai, often including some or all of the following:    Ginger  Cardamom   Cinnamon   Peppercorns  Milk or cream   Sugar (or other sweetener)    Unlike masala chai, which is normally prepared with black tea, Kashmiri pink tea uses green or oolong tea leaves.  Ingredients included in Kashmiri chai that are not included in most other chai recipes:    baking soda (just a pinch)  ground pistachios and/or almonds  salt  white poppy seeds    The final major difference is in the method of preparation. Masala chai can be made in a matter of minutes by boiling the water, then adding tea, milk, spices and boiling it all together for a few minutes before straining and serving. Kashmiri chai, on the other hand, takes 1-2 hours to prepare (I believe the long boiling time is required for the baking soda to accomplish its task of turning the tea pink). I don't know the exact process and couldn't find any sources that seemed reliable.

superuser.stackexchange,51645,How good is the old NEC Multisync 2180UX compared to todays panels?,"The NEC was IPS based, however I'd say its aged worse then a consumer grade TN panels from the same era - IPS is great, but an IPS with a contrast ratio of just 1:500 means that a lot of the color advantage is lost. Combined with todays higher quality TNs that can produce much better blacks then they could 5 years ago, I'd venture to say that an average consumer would rate a Best Buy 21"" TN as being the ""better"" monitor when it came to looks (though a synthetic test would show the NEC produced more accurate colors).  What all this means in terms of the monitors ""value"" is that you are stuck between todays cheap TNs (sub $200), which for the average consumer look a lot better then your IPS, and todays IPS and PVA panels, which have come down in price by a lot. If someone is interested in accurate color, they're likely going to be a lot more interested in a brand new IPS like this which costs what a consumer TN used to cost, then paying a premium for someones 5 year old, 500:1 screen. About the only market I see is for people who still want 4:3 aspect ratio on a large monitor - at that point you're competing with this (though at this time its known that Dell is playing a lottery with that one - you might get an S-IPS, you might get a S-PVA).

academia.stackexchange,3144,Which is more beneficial prior to PhD: research experience or a second Masters degree?,"The question is framed oddly.  A master's degree without research experience will probably kill your chances for PhD admission, at least into the top programs.  Here's a better framing: Is a second master's degree the best way to get more research experience?  Unfortunately, the answer depends on your personal situation.  If you're already doing active research with a strong possibility of formal publication, with well-known faculty collaborators who will write you strong letters of recommendation, then a second MS is probably not necessary.  If that doesn't describe your current research environment, a second MS might be the best way to find such an environment.
