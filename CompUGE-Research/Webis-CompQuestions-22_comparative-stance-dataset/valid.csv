academia.stackexchange,67314,What are the differences (if any) of the tenure-track job hunt if you're a professor compared to a PhD student,"The difference is that when you are a PhD student, everybody knows you won't be around for long, and everything is (or should be) planned accordingly. You are assigned duties knowing that you will move on relatively soon.  Someone with a more permanent position is assumed to be around for much longer. They can take on longer time duties, and other people may start depending on them actually sticking around.  So, if a faculty moves to another place, some people are likely to get upset. Now, people upset with you across the country is not a big deal; but if you advertise it and fail to get the new position, you will have upset people in your own corridor.  Another factor is that, as soon as faculty announce they are likely to move away, people are going to start dividing up their loot: I'll take half of your lab, because you are leaving anyway; I'll teach your favourite course, because you are leaving anyway; we won't buy you the new equipment because you are leaving anyway... Again, if the deal is off and you have to stay, you have lost part of your lab, teaching, and opportunities for equipment or funding. Note that the second factor is also true for positions on soft money, that understandably, no one should count on them sticking around.

softwareengineering.stackexchange,62829,What is better making a separate temporary table or inserting directly to big table?,"  Are the 3000 rows entered evenly throughout the day? If so, that's a row inserted every 29 seconds -- so inserting data as it comes by is hardly anything to worry about.  You'll only benefit creating a temporary table if that table is in MEMORY and then at the end of the day dump that to the main table.      Edit: in reference to the comment ""the data 3000 rows is inserted at once , then what to do ?""  In which case just insert straight into the main table. Adding to another table then dumping that table is just an overhead and completley pointless.

Still an interesting question.  I already asked myself this question, here are some thoughts:    Travel time is employee's time who need to be paid  The plane Berlin - Genova takes 1 h 45, the train 10 h.  During the flight, you are only taking 1 h 45 x the number of crew members.  During the train, you use 10 h x the number of crew members, maybe including night fees.  Infrastructure  Plus, for the train you need a big rail infrastructure that is expensive to build and to maintain.  For the plane you need air, which is still free. (Maybe you pay somewhere the persons who designed air routes.)  Junction fees  For the railway you need to pay train stations and junctions, for the plane you need to pay airport fees.  For the train if the way is inter-countries, you need to split the bill between two or more companies, for the plane it's only the air company.

music.stackexchange,4083,"Learning guitar, start at low end or high end?","Interesting question WSkid. Your question got me thinking, so now I'll try to give an answer that, hopefully, will be useful to you.  I can see your point about playing on the higher end. In fact, most exercises would be easier to do at the higher end, because the frets are spaced closer to each other. However, I think there is a reason why most beginner books/methods start at the lower end. The reason is that beginning at the low end allows the student to learn chords quicker. These beginner books/methods usually want to keep the lessons interesting for a beginner. For most people, it is much more satisfying to be able to play a three chord song then to play scales at the 10-12th frets. Also, its easier for a beginner to apply the things learnt on the lower end (open chord, open scales).  As to the correct method of learning, my answer is: probably a mix of both. Learn open chords at the lower end to give you something fun to play, and practice scales at the upper end to build finger strength and independence, and slowly move the scales to the lower end to increase flexibility and reach. When I first started learning the guitar, I started at the lower end, and gradually learned to move up the fretboard. But had I known what I know now, I probably would have done both.  One more thing, have your guitar checked by more experienced guitarist or a repairman, to make sure the the action on your guitar is not too high. If the action is too high, i.e., the strings are too far away from the frets, it would explain why you find it difficult to to press the lower strings. Quick tip: if the action is too high, or you still want learn at the higher end, then a capo would be a great tool. If the action is too high, just put a capo on the 1st or 2nd fret and the strings will be much easier to press down.

travel.stackexchange,12823,It is cheaper to buy the whole trip or leg by leg?,"It can certainly be less expensive to purchase separate tickets for certain segments as opposed to the complete journey, particularly on a mixed itinerary.  I would strongly advise against this unless you are a very experienced international traveler, for a number of reasons:    Checked baggage - Even if the two airlines you are flying have an interlining agreement, the agent may still refuse to check them through if the segments are on separate tickets. Thus, you would need to claim your baggage, get processed by customs and immigration, and then stand in line to have them re-checked to your next destination.  Flight irregularities - Since the two tickets are independent of one another, agents from the first airline will be unable to protect you on your connecting flight in the event of weather, mechanical problems, air traffic conditions, labor actions, or any of the other things that can cause your first flight to be delayed or canceled.  Indeed, airlines adjust their schedules constantly, and you may find that your first flight has been shifted three hours later, making the connection impossible; you would be responsible for contacting the second airline to make arrangements and to pay any associated change fees. This is of particular concern on international flights, where many routes have frequencies of once a day or even less.     If the flights are on the same record (PNR), you avoid the above scenarios, as the agent would have no reason to refuse interlining your bags, and in the event of problems with any segment that causes you to misconnect, the airline you purchased with would be responsible for booking you on alternative flights. Otherwise, in a worst case scenario, you could be forced to pay thousands of dollars for a walk-up fare to continue your journey. Given that, a few hundred dollars seems like cheap insurance.  I will say that these risks are not serious when booking your outbound and return trips on separate tickets, unless you have a very short turnaround time. It is not necessarily cheaper to do it this way, and you may lose some benefits. For example, a United Airlines round trip award ticket allows both a stopover and an open jaw, but not on two one-way awards, even though each requires the same number of miles.

cooking.stackexchange,21818,What is the difference between pizza sauce and spaghetti sauce?,"Red pizza sauce is often (but not always) two things:    Thicker.  Thinner sauce will tend to run in the oven and also steam the pizza crust as it cooks - if loaded with toppings, otherwise thin is fine.  Depending on the crust, the heat of the oven, the toppings above sauce, and how watery it is, this may not be needed.  If you've just got some crushed tomatoes and a few bits of cheese in a super hot oven - the sauce should be fine without reducing beforehand.  If you've loaded up a bucket of sauce and a pound of cheese, precook and reduce the sauce.  It's often simpler.  Many pasta dishes like spaghetti highlight the sauce and hours of simmering happen for the sauce to bring it to perfection.  They're all about the sauce.  Pizza is really about the crust and what highlights it.  Many of the best pizzas are simply topped.  Crushed san marzano tomatoes (sometimes) reduced with a hint of salt is often all I do, and franky, it's enough. I'm not talking about the jarred varieties here, but what you might cook at home.

gardening.stackexchange,13530,What is the difference between pure horse manure and bedding manure?,"Hmm... well, I don't know the particulars about the straw bedding you've got there but I can tell you the experience here on our farm and what I know about composting horse manure, having done it for the past 10 years or so.  We also compost rabbit, chicken and goat manures here.  Horse manure definitely needs to be composted.  A horse's digestive system is pretty simple and weed seeds can survive it, though I honestly don't see a lot of weeds germinating in our horse and donkey manure.  The manure itself has a good carbon to nitrogen ratio and composts well on its own. Left to its own, it breaks down really well without much other than keeping it moist.  Bedding will generally increase the carbon part of the equation and require additional nitrogen source.  We sometimes add grasses, chicken manure (which is really ""hot"", meaning it's got a high nitrogen content and definitely needs to be composted) and kitchen scraps to it to boost the nitrogen.  Anytime I've got manures mixed with bedding - wood shavings, sawdust or straw, I always ensure that I add a lot of nitrogen to help things move along more quickly.  You can do the lazy composting method - no turning, relying on more anaerobic composting and it'll take longer for both the manure by itself and the manure/bedding to break down or you can engage in what I call my ""farm workout"" by turning the pile to introduce oxygen into the pile and it'll be aerobic and typically break down faster - that's been my experience.  Keeping it moist and turning it often - weekly or a couple times a month might be fine - will speed things up in both cases.  Moisture helps to encourage the decomposition process.  If it dries out, it takes longer, particularly with the bedding.  I don't think my local source of straw uses fungicides and it breaks down reasonably fast.    I try to get my compost bins and piles to contain at least a cubic yard of material as that tends to encourage things to heat up more quickly  but it isn't always possible.  I'd shoot for something in that quantity (or more!) and see how that bedding breaks down.  You might be surprised to see that it does so quickly.

You are right that research potential is an important factor the admission committees of top schools will pay attention to. However, bachelor thesis is not the only way to show that you can do research. You can do research papers with professors' supervision at school B if you want.  I suggest B since you can learn a lot more in B than in A. Building the foundations during undergrad stage is more important than doing research prematurely.   When you apply graduate schools, you need to provide GPA, GRE/TOEFL scores, recommendation letters and any evidence that you can do research.  One of the first things the admission committee will look at is your transcript to determine if you are competent in math. If you stay in A, all you can show is basic to intermediate level math courses. Given that all other conditions will be equal, i.e. you'll get the same GRE/TOEFL scores, about the same recommendation letters (I am not too sure about that), the only thing you can use to beat other applicants is your very good quality bachelor thesis.

academia.stackexchange,66226,PhD programme dilemma: Doing it in a good faculty with strong supervisor or weaker supervisor but more interesting project?,"Based on what you've said I like option A. But of course you know more about this situation than can be conveyed in a post, and there is more information you can find out, to help make the right decision. For context, I am a math PhD student just about to graduate.  Some points for option A:    In my opinion, the most important thing in pursuing a PhD is to be  passionate about the work. I have known people who went about it  differently, picking a topic that they thought would gain them a  reputation so they could later do something interesting, but most of  the time these people end up either not graduating, or taking a very  very long time to graduate, or settling for a mediocre thesis just  to get it over with (which makes it hard to find a job). What you  are about to do is extremely challenging, and you need that personal  drive to get through it.  Now, you can pursue something you are passionate about with both A and B. But the fact that you already know a project that gets you  excited with A outweighs that the supervisor at B has a better  reputation. Especially since the adviser at A is young, maybe s/he  just does not have a good reputation yet. Someone interested in  what you are interested in is valuable, and more rare than you may  expect, and a collaboration can bring good things for both of you.  When someone has a good reputation in academia, it  usually is not a result of their skills as a mentor, or in finding  jobs for their students, or in helping students find their place in  the community. A professor might be good at those things, but it is  not required for them to be known as a great scientist or  mathematician. Nonetheless a professor with such a reputation is  going to attract a lot of students, often for the wrong reasons, and  they must compete for his/her attention, also often for the wrong  reasons. You don't want to join a fleet of satellites.  Schools that are concerned about their reputations are less likely to encourage exploration of unconventional topics.    Everything I've said though is coming from my more categorical impressions. You have the ability to get more information, and maybe what I've said does not even apply. So my main advice is to get more info until you are confident about a choice. One of the best ways to do that is to visit each school over a weekend and, in particular, buy some of the supervisors' students a few drinks.

softwareengineering.stackexchange,111633,What does SVN do better than Git?,"Subversion is a central repository  While many people will want to have distributed repositories for the obvious benefits of speed and multiple copies, there are situations where a central repository is more desirable. For example, if you've got some critical piece of code that you don't want anyone to access, you'd probably not want to put it under Git. Many corporations want to keep their code centralized, and (I guess) all (serious) government projects are under central repositories.  Subversion is conventional wisdom  This is to say that many people (especially managers and bosses) have the usual way to number the versions and seeing the development as a ""single line"" along time hardcoded into their brain. No offense, but Git's liberality is not easy to swallow. The first chapter of any Git book tells you to blank out all the conventional ideals from your mind and start anew.  Subversion does it one way, and nothing else  SVN is a version control system. It has one way to do its job and everybody does it the same way. Period. This makes it easy to transition to/from SVN from/to other centralized VCS. Git is NOT even a pure VCS -- it's a file-system, has many topologies for how to set up repositories in different situations -- and there isn't any standard. That makes it harder to choose one.  Other advantages are:    SVN supports empty directories  SVN has better Windows support  SVN can check out/clone a sub-tree  SVN supports exclusive access control svn lock which is useful for hard-to-merge files  SVN supports binary files and large files more easily (and doesn't require copying old versions everywhere).

softwareengineering.stackexchange,138746,Modularity vs Single class simplicity,"One thing that comes to mind is something I just read in Robert Martin's book: You learned design patterns and you learned solid principles. But all these things should not be applied blindly to any and all code just because you know them. Instead, they should be applied when the alternative would be more complicated than not applying them.  It's a pretty good book and he walks you through a bunch of examples of iterative, test drive development. Throughout the book there's a unifying message that says, keep the code simple, don't introduce extra abstraction layers and patterns. Instead, incrementally add features and converge towards known patterns when that proves to be the simplest solution.  Based on your post, it may have sounded like some of your software could have been considered as over-designed. At the same time I do not know what the skill level for the rest of your team is.  And unfortunately, I can easily imagine other people getting confused when they see 2 classes and an interface even if you were absolutely correct in suggesting them.  In my experience, there are definitely some programmers who do still believe that the goal of our job is to stitch together API calls using any number of control statements needed. And when you need to extend the code, you simply need more control statements. And what makes a good programmer is one that can navigate 600-line method and be able to make it 700 lines while introducing only 2 bugs. And if this is what they believe, you will have a very hard time convincing them otherwise, God knows I've tried.  I don't have a good answer for this type of situation.  My only advice would be to gain support of the project technical lead, or another senior developer that others look up to. Have some discussions and reflections on past code and see if you can identify what was done in the past that worked and that didn't. Once you have them on board with you, gain support of management so that the right people would have the capability of ensuring some level of design makes it into the product.  If you don't have that support, I guess you could either a) look for a different job/team or b) create a bubble of good code around you and try to work in isolation :)  Just remember that we apply patterns and SOLID not because we read about it, but because it IS THE SIMPLEST code we can possibly write. So if you practice this stuff, you should be able to code faster and produce higher quality code than your team mates.  Eventually others, including your management, will notice that.  If you find yourself producing ""proper designs"" but your tasks continuously take you twice as long as they would have otherwise, then you may be missing something (good design might take more time upfront, but you should expect to see a payback in very short future).

softwareengineering.stackexchange,105520,Is it better to develop apps using a platform specific technology or web technologies?,"The big shift toward HTML5/JS came recently with the introduction of hardware acceleration in IE9 and now other browsers.  Before, you just couldn't get the performance out of HTML that you could with Silverlight and Flash.  They had access to hardware and HTML didn't.  The vast majority of mobile browsers support HTML5, and so do their webviews in apps that things like Phonegap takes advantage of.  So in the mobile space, depending upon exactly how much hardware you want to use, HTML5/CSS3/JS is a prerfectly good option.  With Windows 8, there's going to be HTML5 apps in the new tablet view, but native apps are still very much the core part of the experience (Visual Studio won't be HTML5 for example...I don't think).  However, since the markup/JS is hardware accelerated it can now be every bit as fast as a native application.

Secondary, as others mentioned, you must do a stop during your flight at Moscow - unfortunately, in Russia many flights are made with such stop.

Also:  Flight duration from Moscow to Sochi - 2 hours  Flight duration from Moscow to Khanty-Mansiysk - 3 hours, and flight by is made from other airport than you'll land from Frankfurt!, if you choose the UTAir.  You can choose the TransAero, but it's not as cheap as Sochi flight.  And most important part: sightseeing and weather.   Khanty-Mansiysk's average temperature is -9,8 °С, and sometimes there is cold weather,  down to -40.1 °С (March, 1st, 1966).  Sochi's average temperature is +15 °С, with sea temperature up to +9 °С. You can try it out - extreme, but quite fun :) There will be a snow machines for Biathlon in Sochi, but natural snow is in Khanty-Mansiysk.  As for the sightseeing, in Khanty-Mansiysk is all about the World Cup - people there love skiing, and you will be bored there if you are not a fan of it. There are quite small quantity of the sights in Khanty-Mansiysk (in Russian), and even less of them you'll be interested in during cold weather.  As for Sochi, you'll find much more fun there - because it is a very popular touristic center during long time. And because of preparing for the Olympic games, there are much more easier for foreign tourist to get information about city - people started to study languages, and whole touristic situation changed in a good way.

gardening.stackexchange,8290,Is mulch or topsoil better for new lawn in clay soil?,"Not sure where you're from but in the USA you can send a soil sample to your local university extension office and for a nominal fee they will give you a report on the soil that you can use to improve it for your intended purpose. Two key things to look for is the existing organic matter content and cation exchange capacity. This is always a good thing to do before doing major work for a lawn or garden.  When you say ""mulch"" I assume you're talking compost and this is what it's called in your area?  Compost is pretty much the closest thing to a silver bullet when it comes to improving your soil. It can fix all sorts of problems. The only time compost will burn the seed or the seedlings is if it has not been composted properly. This is more of a problem with composted manures which are ""hotter"" or more nutrient rich. A good blend of compost from different sources such as manures, leaves and other plant materials that has been composted completely shouldn't be a problem.  Tilling your soil causes problems but if you need to seriously amend your soil it's the quickest option. A couple of issues are tilling will wind up leaving your lawn uneven and you'll need to fill in areas in the future to level it. Tilling will also bring up a ton of weed seeds that were buried too deep to germinate before so before you plant your grass seed water the soil and give the weeds a couple of weeks to germinate then deal with them before putting down your grass seed.  Clay soil isn't that bad for your lawn as long as you have a decent amount of organic matter already in the soil. You may not want to go to the expensive and effort of tilling in a lot of organic matter (2-6"") into your soil all at once. Another option if your soil has at least 5% organic matter and decent cation exchange capacity you can just top dress with about a 1/4"" layer of compost. This would require 1 cubic yard of compost per 1,000 sq ft. Do this every year for the next 3 years or so and then start doing it less frequently if you are happy with what you're seeing. Time, worms and other organisms will help work it further into the soil.   You should also do a percolation test to see how well the water drains.

At the high end of the market, people worry about the tonal qualities of various kinds of wood, but for the most part, we worry about an electric guitar body being as rigid as possible, and the pickups are where most of the character comes from.  On an acoustic guitar, the construction of the guitar itself has the most impact on its sound. You are hearing the vibration of the sound board, so what's important is the frequencies that are absorbed or reinforced by the way the body vibrates, and the way the bridge transmits vibration from the string to the body.  You can put great strings on a bad acoustic guitar, and it will still sound bad.  How do you know a guitar is good quality? Use your ears. If you can't hear the difference, the difference isn't important!  However, one rule of thumb is that plywood is the mark of a cheap guitar.

travel.stackexchange,21901,"Which airport has better connections with the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus in Hinxton, Stansted or Cambridge?","As you've probably discovered the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus in very much Cambridgeshire not Cambridge itself. In fact, it's about a third of the way to Stansted!  Cambridge airport is small, so your time from plane to kerb will be very quick. Stansted, not so much...  By taxi, it's about 12 miles from Cambridge airport to Hinxton. If you've pre-booked a minicab, it should take about 25 minutes. A metered local taxi would be about £30, but you can probably negotiate a lower fare if you pre-book a minicab. I'm not sure there are taxis waiting at the airport normally, as it's small, so you might need to book anyway.  By bus from Cambridge airport, you'd need to get a bus into town (11 or 77), then either a Citi 7 to nearby, or the Park and Ride bus to the Babraham Road Park-and-Ride then the 7A to Hinxton. Plan for about 1.5-2 hours  From Stansted, in a taxi it'll only be about 30 minutes, as it's a motorway almost the whole way. Downside is it's 20 miles, with an airport pickup surcharge, so it'll be quite a bit more money than Cambridge. My hunch is about £45 for a local taxi, less if you pre-book a minicab and negotiate something.  Public transport from Stansted to Hinxton isn't great though. You can ask Google Maps, but the fact that it often suggests taking a train from Stansted to London then train London to Cambridge then bus then walk should give you some idea... There doesn't look to be any local buses covering the route, so you're pretty much stuck with train or long distance coach to Cambridge (passing Hinxton on the motorway without stopping), then basically the same local buses as you'd have got from Cambridge airport.  If it were me, and the flight costs were about the same, I'd suggest flying to Cambridge, bus into town, enjoy a little bit of time in the city centre, then taxi out to Hinxton.

academia.stackexchange,17378,"In which type of schools can I have better research experience in Biology, liberal arts college or large research university?","I went to a small liberal arts college and worked at a large university lab, that had undergraduate interns. From both experiences I agree that it is the lab and not the school that matters. However, there are conditions that you will be more or less likely to find, depending on the type of school. In general liberal arts colleges will give you more personal attention and large universities will have more resources. Funding at liberal arts colleges is focused on undergraduate education and funding at larger universities is focused on research.   Personal Attention:   Liberal arts: A lab is led by a principal investigator or PI. Liberal arts colleges often do not have graduate students or have few graduate programs. So, at a small liberal arts college you will work closely with your PI and get to know them well. I left my college with great letters of rec that helped me overcome a poor GPA (due to a medical problem in my first two years) and get into grad school.   University: The undergrads were trained by PhDs and post docs and had little contact with the faculty. Post docs and PhDs can often be great teachers, though, since they either are students or were students recently and might be able to anticipate the student's perspective. At a university, they will normally write your letters of recommendation and the faculty will sign them.   Independence:   Liberal Arts: All of our grants were training grants, so the emphasis was on teaching, as opposed to producing results. This means you will get to do more independent work. I got first hand experience with the equipment (EEG) and techniques (analysis of FMRI and EEG data) that few undergraduates get to use. Additionally, I know of at least two of my friends who published, as first authors, in major research journals. This is not uncommon in my school.   University: The undergrads had to learn a program that is no longer used by most labs in the field. There was little room for mistakes (all of the labs grants were research grants), so the undergrads were given the task of modifying previous work and really did not develop any understanding of how the program actually works. However, this lab was an older lab. I also believe students at an older lab at my undergraduate school had a similar experience, where the methodology they were taught was not consistent with current standards in the field.   Connections:  They are pretty equal in this area. Liberal arts college professors often collaborate with people at larger institutions and can connect you with other labs. I have friends who got summer jobs at Stanford and CalTech this way. At the large university, one of our undergrads got to go to Oxford for the summer, because of the professor's connections to a lab there.   Equipment and Resouces:   Liberal arts: We did not have access to some of the most expensive equipment (an MRI, for example). However, one of my professors also worked at a local university that had access to an MRI and we got to use it there. Ideally, you should get some lab experience at a major research university, so you are exposed to techniques that require more expensive equipment. You can do this during summer internships. Getting more experience at different labs will look good on your application.   On that note, a liberal arts college is more likely to have grants that will help students study at other institutions. My college had several such grants for student research grants. Additionally, all senior thesis was funded by the department. The senior thesis funding and one of the summer fellowships both require students to focus on their own original ideas. In most fields the first author is the person who had the idea for the project. This is how undergraduate students were able to become first authors.  University: Universities will have the best equipment, but they are less likely to have funding for student research. The institution I worked at had grants for students, but they were only for work at that university. They also had no specific grants that would allow students to propose their own projects, based on their own ideas.

travel.stackexchange,21632,Japan: Car rental vs public transport,"In general, you will want to use public transport as much as possible in Japan. Trains travel throughout the country and are clean, punctual and affordable, whereas with cars, driving on highways is very expensive (Tokyo-Osaka is ~US$150 in tolls), driving in urban areas is painful (very narrow roads, expensive parking), and gas is expensive everywhere.    The main exception is if you plan on exploring the deep countryside.  Hokkaido outside Sapporo, in particular, is definitely best explored by car, as are the Japan Alps and rest of Japan's mountainous spine.  The easiest solution is thus to combine the two: take the train out to the general area you want to explore, then rent a car at the station.  JR's Ekiren service (aka ""Trenta"", as in train-rental-car) is the best way to do this, and they often have promotional packages that combine train tickets and rental car.  Unfortunately Ekiren's site is Japanese only, but Japan Experience and ToCoo! offer English wrappers around it, with English roadside support as well.

softwareengineering.stackexchange,111180,"For user defined data, is it better to use a table of tables or dynamically created tables?","A generic database design limits the proliferation of new tables as the number of forms and data elements grows. On the other hand even the simplest query involved 3 tables, in our case.   Queries indeed got very mind boggling. After 3 years of this I became of the opinion that explicit tables was better. I'd rather deal with more tables that better reflect the business form/model - that I can understand just by looking at them; vice 1/2 the tables but with multitudes of meaningless join tables requiring astonishing long, nested queries to make even the most rudimentary sense out of the data. You actually start memorizing the meaning/context of individual identity column primary keys!  Finally, we had evolved to where we had that one table to rule them all so as to get away from some of the inherent complexities (and bad coding and design decisions of the past) in the existing design and evolving user requirements. Nonetheless, we were certain we'd have problems as the table size went into the million+ row size.

cooking.stackexchange,21695,What is the difference between quick bread and cake?,"This question has become blown out of proportion. I was just curious- then I started getting answers that quickbreads and cake are the same thing- which they ""obviously"" aren't. So I started doing my own research.  Wikipedia says that the term quickbread was probably invented in the US after the discovery of chemical leavening. The Wikipedia references and some dictionaries corroborate this definition. Basically anything leavened with soda is quickbread.  This doesn't work. There are a great many things leavened with soda that can't be called quickbread. A good example is plain old white cake. Obviously this is a semantic issue but one that needed solving.  Two American cookbooks that I consider canonical recipe resources, The Joy of Cooking, and the Better Homes and Gardens cookbook, both have a separate quickbread section. In it are a variety of fruit breads as well as some biscuits and scones.  On Food and Cooking muddied the water a bit by differentiating between quick breads such as biscuits and batter breads such as banana bread. These were grouped together, however, and contrasted against cakes. This book says that cakes are higher in fat and sugar and have a more delicate texture.  Ratio, as linked in this answer, confused the terms a bit more also including a term ""quick cake"" but it differentiated between the different products with distinct ratios for the flour, fat, and sugar.  With several competing definitions I decided to take an unscientific poll. I called 6 friends in Washington, Utah, Georgia, and Texas. I tried to find a variety of American cultures. Obviously it is biased by the fact that I know all of them.  When asked ""What is quickbread to you?"" without exception all of them replied ""banana bread""  When I followed up with: ""What is the difference between that and cake"" I received the following answers:    ""It is eaten at breakfast""  ""It has less sugar""  ""It is loaf shaped""  ""It is more dense""  ""It has a more open texture""    My conclusion is that the historical definition of ""anything with soda"" is no longer useful. In cookbooks it seems to now be applied to chemically risen baked goods that:      have as a rule of thumb a particular ratio of flour, fat, and sugar  have less sugar than cake  refers in particular to fruit breads, biscuits, and scones  generally has an irregular vs uniform texture    The popular definition (among my extremely limited, unrandom sampling) adds:    tends to be loaf shaped    And now I can sleep easily again.

softwareengineering.stackexchange,39013,Need advice: Staying techie or going the MBA way?,"My  personal experience is 25 years being a developer or technical things over a wide range (my experience is s/w + h/w + all sorts). I've done bits of project management and so on along the way as well.  There are a few points I can make:    If you have the technical skills and ability and like what you do then your challenge is to stay current and relevant, technically.  If you move off to something else where you chase the $ but don't like it, you will be filled with regret, and hate what you are doing. Its common to live the lifestyle that comes with a bigger paycheck and so you struggle to go back to what you like that pays less.  In all my years in technology I've come across only 1 person who benefited from doing an MBA. They didn't finish but learned enough about project cost accounting and tracking to spot the early signs of a project running off the rails. THIS PART OF AN MBA is about 3 months or less of the total. [AND everyone else who had done an MBA was a dangerous fool.]  Some of the most switched on, savvy business people I know have never done an MBA. And I know one who started and gave up in disgust, his view was summed up as ""If I did this crap in my business I'd go broke"". Except he was a lot blunter.    I've been pushed to do an MBA on and off over the last 15 years, and procrastination was the best thing I ever did.   If you really want to broaden your horizons then pick off some courses on project management and project cost tracking. Put your peril-sensitive sunglasses on and have your bullshit detector finely tuned. Listen and think and pick out the good bits rather than slavishly following the advice.  And then go buy the following books:    ""Slack"" and ""Peopleware"" and ""The Deadline"" - All by De Marco. You will find good prices from The Book Depository or Amazon.  ""The Goal"" by Eli Goldratt.     Read these and have a huge big think (especially about the differences between them, and how the principles from ""The goal"" might apply to s/w development - its not what you might first think). You'll probably learn more from these than any MBA will ever teach you.  Unfortunately many MBA people have no other experience, or no real-world experience in what they try to manage. They exemplify a modern belief that to manage something you don't need to know the work, even the technical domain. All you are doing after all is managing. Sadly, nothing could be further from the truth. Managers with this view, puffed up by an MBA, are dangerous. Check out what urban dictionary has to say about LOMBARD and you'll know what I mean.

gardening.stackexchange,19891,Pros and Cons of wood vs stone mulch,"I'm not a fan of stone/gravel mulch. I use it in one spot for a specific reason but it's hard to keep it looking clean. Weeds will still grow in it or past it. Either because the landscape fabric underneath deteriorates or because organic material falls onto the gravel and collects in the spaces between the gravel and allows seeds to germinate.  If you want to clean it well you basically have to set up a sifting operation like an 1850's prospector. Since it doesn't decompose topping it off with fresh gravel just creates a deeper mulch bed. As the landscape fabric wears out the gravel can sink into the soil so when that happens I guess you can top off then.  It doesn't really suppress weeds as well as organic mulches. It's mostly the landscape fabric that does that. If you ever want to change it it's a giant PITA.  The microclimate around the gravel bed will be warmer and retain heat longer which may cause issues with some plants or require more frequent watering.  I'm not a big fan of generic wood mulch either. For wood mulch I prefer cedar mulch because that's one of the better choices available around me. The oils in it can repel insects such as termites, cedar mulch is less likely to harbor artillery fungus (as does cypress and pine park mulch), it lasts a long time, I don't have to worry as much about scrap pressure treated wood or toxic paint winding up in the mulch and I like the smell when I put it down.  A 1/2 cubic foot bag of gravel costs about $4. For that same $4 I can get a high quality 3 cubic foot bag of cedar mulch. It's lighter, easier to work with, suppresses weeds when put on thick enough, breaks down to add nutrients to the soil. Insulates the soil and retains moisture and I like the way it looks.   You put on about 3"" the first year, then add about 1"" every year, or even every other year depending on your climate. After a month or so the color fades to grey. You can get died mulches but the color only lasts about a season and will need to be topped off to look new or you can get some mulch dyes to refresh the color.  Haven't had an issue with either washing away but the cedar mulch seems to hold better on slopes.  Aesthetics... when done properly stone mulch can have a very dramatic and high end look. When it starts to look like crap then it looks like crap. Organic mulches are easy to refresh and have looking like new by only topping off a bit every year.  Costs for a 100 square foot bed with 3"" of mulch:  Stone: Initial cost 50 bags * $4 = $200 though 50 bags is a lot to transport bulk pricing would be cheaper.  Cedar: Initial cost 9 bags * $4 = $36  Top off with 3 bags every year = $12 a year.  It would take over 12 years for the cedar mulch to cost as much as the stone. Are you sure you're not going to want to rearrange your landscape, want to change color scheme in mulch or will still like the same look for such a long period of time?  Spreading around some extra mulch on top of beds to me feels a lot easier than trying to clean gravel beds.

academia.stackexchange,2019,What are the trade-offs of working in the office versus elsewhere (as a professor)?,"I think it's important to set boundaries with students, with colleagues, and with yourself about when and where you're available for meetings.  It's also important to find environments that most effectively support different types of work, and give yourself permission to use them.  Like you, when I'm in my office, I expect to be interrupted; so when I'm working at my desk, I can only productively work on tasks that survive interruption.  Put bluntly, the office is where I have meetings; if I need to think, I find a whiteboard in an empty conference room; if I need to write, I go to a coffee shop.  (Suresh is correct; I am in a coffee shop right now.)  As Daniel says, all three places allow for productive work, but of very different types.  Even in the computer science building, for small meetings where I don't want to be interrupted, I prefer to go to the other person's office.  And because my undergraduate office hours are occasionally very popular (especially right before exams), I don't hold them in my actual office, but in a larger room down the hall with couches and whiteboards.  You express two points of concern, which I'll exaggerate:    My students won't like me if I'm not available on their schedule.  I agree with DQdlM and Nate.  Spread out your office hours to fit as many students' schedules as possible, be in your office (or ""office"") for every minute of office hours even if nobody shows up, and be willing to offer occasional off-schedule meetings.  It might help to announce in your syllabus times that you're willing to schedule sporadic meetings.  (""I'm also available for occasional meetings Tuesday or Thursday afternoons; send me email to set up an appointment!"")  Consider moving (not adding) your office hours if student demand doesn't match your announced schedule.  But then stick to your guns.  Yes, some students will be unhappy, but that's inevitable; don't take it personally.  Your availability outside regular office hours will not be the most significant bit in your student evaluations.  My colleagues won't like me if they don't see me in my office.  I agree with DQdlM and Suresh here.  Yes, it's important to be visible and active citizen of your department; that's not the same thing as being constantly on call.  The amount of time you spend at your desk will not be the most significant bit in your tenure evaluation.  The danger is not that nobody sees you in your office, but that nobody knows what you're doing.  Give regular talks to your colleagues and their PhD students showing off the results of your out-of-office effort.  Go to faculty meetings, and occasionally offer an opinion.  (Careful, that gun is loaded.)  Attend seminars, especially for faculty candidates, and ask questions.  If there is a regular departmental social event (""Tea"" in many math departments), be there.  And so on.    Finally, I strongly encourage you to raise these concerns with your department chair or your senior faculty mentors.  (You do have a senior faculty mentor, don't you?  If not, find one!)  They can help you navigate your department culture far better than Some Guy On The Intertubes.

travel.stackexchange,20607,"Alaska, from Anchorage to Fairbank, car/hotel vs MotorHome","It is a common misconception that using a motorhome is cheaper than flying, or even staying in a hotel.    Trust me, when you check the rates at the various motor home rental agencies, it's not.  Cruise America, for example, charges $900 for 10 days, plus a fee for every mile you drive.  And that is before you consider the gas, which at 10mpg, adds up.  Yes, if you already own one, you save, but renting mitigates that.  Is there a fuel calculator for RV travel in USA/Canada? will answer the cost of gas piece. The extra gas (10mpg vs. 30mpg) often has a way of costing about as much as the hotel.   Trent over at the TheSimpleDollar.com once did a cost comparison - and when his site is back up, I'll link to it :)  In the end, the gas and depreciation was a wash over a hotel.  In the end, its going to cost about the same to stay in a motor home or get hotels.  The difference isn't in the cost, but rather the freedom a motor home brings. As a proud and happy RV'er, that alone is worth it.  Alaska in particular has a reputation as being friendly to RVs - the wide open spaces, lack of bridges, etc... actually make driving it fairly common.  Still, the Alaska Highway is notoriously long - ""miles and miles of miles and miles.""  Again, if you're looking for cheap, the time savings of a plane should be factored against the drive.

softwareengineering.stackexchange,102771,When would polling for events be better than using observer pattern?,"Imagine you want to get notified about every engine cycle, e.g. to display an RPM measurement to the driver.  Observer pattern: The engine publishes an ""engine cycle"" event to all observers for each cycle. Create a listener that counts events and updates the RPM display.  Polling: The RPM display asks the engine at regular intervals for an engine cycle counter, and updates the RPM display accordingly.  In this case, the observer pattern would probably loose: the engine cycle is a high-frequency, high-priority process, you don't want to delay or stall that process just to update a display. You also don't want to thrash the thread pool with engine cycle events.    PS:  I also use the polling pattern frequently in distributed programming:  Observer pattern: Process A sends a message to process B that says ""each time an event E occurs, send a message to Process A"".  Polling pattern: Process A regularly sends a message to process B that says ""if you event E occured since the last time I've polled, send me a message now"".  The polling pattern produces a bit more network load. But the observer pattern has downsides, too:    If process A crashes, it will never unsubscribe, and process B will try to send notifications to it for all eternity, unless it can reliably detect remote process failures (not an easy thing to do)  If event E is very frequent and/or the notifications carry a lot of data, then process A might get more event notifications than it can handle. With the polling pattern, it can just throttle the polling.  In the observer pattern, high load can cause ""ripples"" through the whole system.

academia.stackexchange,65666,"Which is better, a paper with pedantic vocabularies or a paper easy to read?","There is a third way:  Be pedantic about your vocabulary in the right way to make your paper more readable.  Using established, clear, and consistent vocabulary and defining it when necessary is the best way to ensure that you are not misunderstood. The main advantage of “simple and easy words” is that they do not need to be explained to the reader, but this also entails that you rely on the reader interpreting these words the same way as you do, which may be not given surprisingly often. Defined vocabulary does not have this disadvantage.   Moreover, you need to at least need to mention the established, “pedantic” vocabulary for context and to avoid the impression of reinventing the wheel. By consistently sticking to it, you avoid switching between different terms for the same thing, which usually impedes intelligibility.  However, you should also bear in mind that readers unfamiliar with this vocabulary may want to read your paper. For these readers, define the more uncommon words and cite papers explaining the basic underlying concepts. Papers are not difficult to read because they contain new words, but because these words are not properly explained or because the reader does not understand the concepts represented by them. For example if you write a paper on theoretical particle physics, readers will have to understand some elementary aspects of quantum theory to follow your thoughts. Using vocabulary that can only appeal to readers without this basic understanding of quantum theory is pointless and only raises false expectations.  Finally, if you get to introduce new concepts, you can try to choose words for them appeal to intuition, but this does not mean that you are relieved from the burden of explaining these words.
