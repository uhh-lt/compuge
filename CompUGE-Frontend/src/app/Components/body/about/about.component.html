      This System was built in the process of the research conducted by the Author Ahmad Shallouf for his Master Thesis at the University of Hamburg.
      <br>
      The purpose of this system is to provide a Benchmark for the 4 main tasks of Comparative Question Answering in the English Language.
      <br>
      The system is built using the Angular Framework for the Frontend and FastAPI Framework for the Backend with a PostgreSQL Database.

        <h2>Comparative Question Identification</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 18px">
          The comparative question identification task involves detecting and classifying questions that aim to compare entities, such as products or services. This task is important for applications like review summarization, recommendation systems, and opinion mining. Researchers have developed methods involving natural language processing techniques to accurately identify and categorize comparative questions from user-generated content. These methods often require syntactic and semantic analysis to understand the nuances and patterns in language that indicate comparisons.
          <br> <br>
          Recent advancements in this field include the use of machine learning models and neural networks to improve the accuracy of identifying comparative questions. These models are trained on large datasets to recognize both explicit and implicit comparisons. Challenges in this area include handling context-dependent comparisons and refining algorithms to better capture the intent behind complex linguistic structures. This work enhances applications by providing deeper insights into user preferences and opinions through effective comparison detection.

        <h2>Object and Aspect Identification</h2>
        <p>
          Object and Aspect Identification is the sequence tagging task that aims at identifying certain entities (objects, aspects, predicates, etc.) in the comparative questions.
          We have encountered at least three different datasets on the task.
          The dataset <a href="https://aclanthology.org/P10-1028/" target="_blank">Li et al., 2010</a>
          is not publicly available, where they aim at extracting objects of comparison.
          The other two datasets (<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frai.2022.732836/full" target="_blank">Beloucif et al., 2022</a>;
          <a href="https://ar5iv.org/2304.04339" target="_blank">Bondarenko et al., 2022a</a>)
          have different annotation schema and tags, which means that they cannot be straightforwardly combined.
          <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2021.bsnlp-1.2/" target="_blank">Chekalina et al., 2021</a>
          also presents a dataset with objects and an aspect of comparison.
          However, it comprises labeled affirmative sentences instead of questions, which makes it inapplicable for our purposes according to
          (<a href="https://ar5iv.org/2304.04339" target="_blank">Bondarenko et al., 2022a</a>).
