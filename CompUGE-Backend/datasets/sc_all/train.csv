It contains this comparison chart that tells you everything technical that you ever wanted to know and were afraid to ask about.  More importantly, it contains detailed performance analysis for different screen resolutions in the section First-Person 3D Shooters.

A master's degree without research experience will probably kill your chances for PhD admission, at least into the top programs.  Here's a better framing: Is a second master's degree the best way to get more research experience?  Unfortunately, the answer depends on your personal situation.  If you're already doing active research with a strong possibility of formal publication, with well-known faculty collaborators who will write you strong letters of recommendation, then a second MS is probably not necessary.  If that doesn't describe your current research environment, a second MS might be the best way to find such an environment.  ",1

Document how the function works (if it's not obvious from the code) in the source file, or more accurately, close to the definition.    For the birds-eye thing in the header, you don't necessarily need the documentation that close - you can document groups of declarations at once.  Broadly speaking, the caller should be interested in errors and exceptions (if only so they can be translated as they propogate through the layers of abstraction) so these should be documented close to the relevant declarations.

"imitation vanilla [SEP] true vanilla extract [SEP] Yes, you can detect the difference. How much of a difference will depend on the quality of both the imitation and of the real thing.  That said, it's difficult if not impossible for me to pick out the differences in baked goods.

I've never tried the american ones consciously (they're not imported to Europe as far as I know).  You could also take into account that the fresher the truffles are the better the quality, so in theory it would be better to eat american truffles in the USA and european truffles in Europe.  Given the mind boggling price differences and the supposed high quality of the stuff found in the forests in Oregon, you're likely going to be well off picking the local stuff.  ",0
"an Intel Celeron [SEP] Intel Pentium processor [SEP] Basically, The Pentium line is the mainstream performance chip, and it has many optimised routines built in that make certain tasks perform fast.  For a Celeron, they heavily cut costs and generally have less on board memory, and the result is a much cheaper chip that performs reasonably well (and generally at less power), but not as good as an equal ghz/mhz Pentium / Core 2 of the same generation.

So, i start by trying to trace some simple flow through the code; if it's a webapp, it could be a request or a sequence of requests, for instance. Once i've done that, i have a sort of skeleton to hang more understanding on.

"electric stoves [SEP] gas stoves [SEP] Can I convince you that electric is better? No, I can't, because I don't think it is. The issue I have is related to how long it takes to warm up (and cool down). Electric cook tops just don't respond quickly. Little too hot? Too bad, nothing you can do about it (in time to save a dish that's starting to burn anyway). Not hot enough? Check back in 2 or 3 minutes.

They can shatter if dropped on a hard surface, and can easily get get notched on bone.  I use my ceramics exclusively for vegetables for that reason.    If you're strapped for funds, you really only need to by one expensive knife (a steel chef's knife or santoku), and one cheap one (a serrated knife for cutting bread).  After that, picking up knife skills is more important and will make your cooking better than any investment in more knives.  ",1

"C [SEP] C++ [SEP] My favorite reason for not using C++ is that C has a de facto standard ABI on most platforms.  In other words, because there's no name mangling, etc., you can usually link code compiled with two different C compilers.  With C++, good luck because you'lll need it.  ",0
"Square [SEP] Round Container [SEP] I can think of two reasons to prefer square containers :    They store in less space for the same volume, when you're dealing with dozens of them (as the smoothie shops likely are)  The key to a good blending is that the inside is not round -- you need baffles and such to keep the blender from forming a single, smooth vortex.

The only way in which it might confuse newbies is that it requires them to understand that complex boolean expressions are A) still expressions like any other and B) can be used wherever a boolean value is required, rather than just inside an if clause.  But this is something newbies really need to understand, so you should never let the possibility of someone not yet understanding it influence your code.  ",1

"RSA [SEP] DSA [SEP] The GPG maintainers are thinking of changing the default to RSA (source: Dealing with weakness in SHA-1 [LWN.net]). So, it seems they think RSA is currently the better option (and they should know more about it than you or me).  ",0
Windows 7 [SEP] Windows XP [SEP] All the older computer i have running XP seem to run better with Windows 7.  These computers include:  P4 1.8 Ghz with HT and 1GB ram  Celeron 1.6 Ghz 1GB ram  Give it a try.  ,0
"Bruges [SEP] Ghent [SEP] Both cities are really interesting destinations. The question to distinct between the two is whether or not you like tourist spots. Bruges is the more touristic city of the two. Personally I would go ofr Ghent and do a day trip to Bruges. But the other way around is perfectly possible.   However if you really would like to escape the crowds, go to Lier or Hasselt. No tourists and really pearls to visit.  ",0
"university teaching [SEP] high school teaching experience [SEP] If there is an option definitely university teaching is more valuable as it is at the same level as the teaching you will experience while doing your degree. However, you should consider that PhD is a research-based degree and teaching obligation is not primary concern. So you might get the position without having any teaching experience and finally get your PhD being a year or so younger.     ",0
"drinking alcohol [SEP] pills [SEP] If you have no specific medical condition that would be exacerbated by anti-anxiety drugs, I'd say you should at least try them to see if they work well for you. Most of them don't have serious side effects if you don't take too many, or too often.  Excessive drinking has well-documented negative effects, among them the possibility of violent behaviour that can get you into really bad trouble (as in: gigantic fines/damages, or even jail time) on a plane.

"milk powder [SEP] fresh milk [SEP] Poaching is a gentle process - the milk isn't boiling so there is no risk of it burning or the like. It will of course not spoil in the sense of it going off, that's a totally different process.  Fresh milk is better because, well, it's fresh. Powdered milk would probably work, but if you have fresh, use that.  ",0
"Gaussian Blur [SEP] Down Sampling [SEP] Down sampling may discard relevant features, while blurring should not.  As a toy example, a down sample may remove a pixel which is a local maxima, while a blur operation will preserve the maxima by increasing the values of nearby pixels. If the local maxima corresponds to an interesting feature, it may still be discernible by the human eye after blurring.  From a computational sense, Laplacian pyramids are able to reconstruct an image precisely because a blur-subtract operation preserves the ""information"" in the scene.  ",0
"Integer Linear Programming [SEP] Mixed Integer Linear Programming [SEP] Knowing that integer programming (ILP) is NP-complete, it follows that mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is NP-complete too as MILP generalizes ILP.  My guess is that your thinking and feeling comes from insufficient testing: you don't have enough test cases with different structure, and you don't mention what algorithms you use. Even though both problems are hard, there are (even exact) algorithms that perform well on suitably structured instances. You should look at where the really hard instances are (they are not necessarily large), and try running your algorithms again.  ",1
"to use a Database [SEP] a data structure [SEP] If you can fit everything into available memory why not use one of the many Hash map libraries/templates available for C/C++.  You will get a massive performance boost (no disks, no IO, no parsing no .....) and most of the APIs available are pretty simple to use.  Have a look at this comparison to see which one would best suit your needs.  ",1
"to pick herbs from the top [SEP] bottom of the plant [SEP] I would take basil by pinching whole stems off. The new growth is the best tasting and the plant will sprout multiple new stems from the old one. You have to be careful not to overdo it which is why you might want more than one plant to produce enough basil on a regular basis. Most herbs will respond to this treatment, I can't think of any exceptions, but I am sure there are some.  ",2
"functionality [SEP] design [SEP] Functionality  Design can come later, core functionality is key to a deliverable product.  Disregarding design, the key is to get a deliverable functioning product out the door sooner rather then later. Design is a secondary objective. If you can't make it work, then all the flowers and pretty colors won't save you. Having a working product, with minimal design work will.  Perfectly adhering to a pattern or OOP principals are great, but often you will find that for the sake of producing something that works they will have to be ignored in some cases.   ",0
"comfort [SEP] teamwork [SEP]   Get some chat software installed    Aside from that you may find some of the other developers find verbal communication breaks them out of the productive 'zone', regardless of how work related the talk is.  Also of note is that by having everyone in the same location, while work talk between Dev A and Dev B may be productive, it is most likely nothing but distracting noise to Dev C, Dev D, ...  ",0
"Paint.NET [SEP] MS Paint [SEP] There is Paint.NET. It is a free image editing software. It is easy to handle as MS Paint, but contains a lot of advanced features. It supports many different formats. I use it very often to edit images. It is easy to handle and available with translations for different languages.   Paint.NET:    is free  has a modern interface  supports painting on the image  is able to change the size of the paper, the image and crop the image  has vector graphic support, made possible via a plugin  makes it possible to stitch images together How to stitch images in Paint.NET  has support for add-ons      ",0
"key-value [SEP] subject-predicate-object [SEP] Following your simplicity argument (binary is more fundamental than octal), I'd say that key-value stores are more fundamental.  I think that Subject-Predicate is essentially a 'compound' or 'aggregate' key, so a subject-predicate-object store is a key-value store with additional requirements on the key (namely that it can be split into two).

"to cut [SEP] tear basil leaves [SEP] Tearing is for artistic effect  Some people will claim tearing does not damage the cell of the plant as much as cutting, a simple look under a basic microscope will show you otherwise. Not sure how this would affect basil in particular. What dish are you preparing?  If you want more basil flavour and smell, cut it more finely, or bruise it (back of knife or rolling pin) to release more oils just before serving  ",0
"Westell [SEP] Linksys [SEP] I've had a Westell 7500 for one day, and so far, I don't like it.  One workaround that I have discovered for DynDNS:  If you use Mac OS X, there is a DynDNS widget that will update DynDNS for you.  [REF]  ",0
"LISP's macro [SEP] Ruby's ""ability"" to create DSL [SEP] Read On Lisp and then decide for yourself.  My summary is that Ruby is better at providing convenient syntax.  But Lisp wins, hands down, at the ability to create new abstractions, and then to layer abstraction on abstraction.  But you need to see Lisp in practice to understand that point.  Hence the book recommend.  ",1
"Waiting once at startup for a long time [SEP] waiting frequently for a short time [SEP] Startup as fast as possible, use a thread to do the most important calculations. So the user gets a feedback immediately, and can start working after 15 secs. In the background, let another thread calculate everything, so after two minutes, those 2-3 sec response times also go away.  ",0
"Low-quality paper [SEP] no paper [SEP] If the quality of the work is low, the student should neither publish it in a lower tier conference nor publish it as a technical report.  They should either make the time to improve it or toss it in the trash.  A bad publication, no matter what venue it's published in, is worse than no publication at all.  Similarly, a ""publication"" listed in a CV or described in a statement of purpose that isn't retrievable via google (unlike most technical reports, which are googlable) is also worse than no publication at all, because we can't tell if the applicant is lying.  (Sadly, some applicants are lying.)  ",0
"an open-ended ticket [SEP] a one-way ticket [SEP] Even if flexible return tickets are more expensive, it could be cheaper than two One-Way tickets, due to the way how airlines calculate their OW fares. You could also try to get a good fare which is not completely restricted (e.g. changing the date for a fee like 100$), which could still be cheaper than flexible ones, even if you add the fee.  ",1
"frying [SEP] baking meatballs [SEP] No recipe alteration needed.  Fried meatballs will develop more of a crust, and thus more flavour through the Maillard reaction. In any case, unless you're making tiny meatballs (or finishing their cooking in a sauce of some sort), they're going to need to be finished via baking anyway.  I would only do the baking method if I had to make an enormous quantity at once. For home cooking I always fry then bake.  ",2
"institution [SEP] specialization [SEP] If your interest is in ""industry,"" I'd choose a school based on the institution. Most employers look at that as the ""headline,"" and often ""gloss over"" the actual content of the degree.  If your interest was in research, I'd go the other way and emphasize ""specialization."" Because that is what research is basically about.  ",1
"using a dedicated rice cooker [SEP] cooking rice in a pot [SEP] Yes there are benefits! This is one of my most used pieces of kitchen equipments. Here is a list of benefits for a quality rice cooker:    Never burns rice  No guess measurements for all kinds of rice  Scheduled cooking  Keep warm settings  Uniform cooking    When I cook rice on my stove, even at the lowest of heats, I get a thin layer of rice that has overcooked stuck to the bottom of the pot.  For the record I have the Zojirushi 5-1/2 cup induction rice cooker. Best thing ever.  ",0
"SSD [SEP] Superfetch [SEP] I doubt that RAM is the bottleneck, unless you are running multiple VMs or something like that.  Read/write speeds are most likely the bottleneck on any modern machine, so getting a faster drive is usually the best solution.  ",0
"""deadlock prevention"" [SEP] ""deadlock avoidance"" [SEP] It seems that deadlock prevention and deadlock avoidance are two names for the same concept. Indeed, the Wikipedia section on deadlock avoidance has been marked as redundant. While the distinction might be taken from the literature, some people at least are arguing that this distinction is superfluous. See the paper The classification of deadlock prevention and avoidance is erroneous by Neumann Levine, which is mentioned in the Talk part of the Wikipedia article.  ",1
"Turing machines [SEP] pushdown automata [SEP] If you only consider that 'Turing machines can always be made to behave like a stack' you can only conclude that they are at least as powerful as pushdown automata.  But in general, yes it is true, Turing machines are more powerful than PDAs. The easiest example would be to show that Turing machines can describe Context Sensitive Languages.  ",0
"a BSc at a top-ranked university [SEP] a MComp at a lower-ranked university [SEP] If you can attend a top university, do so.  Having other excellent students around can provide a much better learning environment--to the point that in three years at a top place you may learn as much as in four years at a more mediocre institution.  If you do well, you can always do another one or two years of graduate study after your bachelor's degree.   ",0
